{"role":"interviewer","content":"Welcome, Becky. To start, may I use your name, and how would you like me to refer to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, please call me Becky. I\u2019m a comic book artist, so you might catch me doodling in the waiting room sometimes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing your passion for art. Becky, I\u2019ll be asking some questions to understand your experiences better. Would that be okay with you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that's okay. I just hope we can figure out how to get my creativity back... I've been stuck for months."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that creativity feels tied up right now. Before we begin, do you have any questions about how this will work or anything else?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t have any questions right now. I\u2019m just hoping we can work through these feelings of... of doubting my own passion. It\u2019s been eating at me for a while."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that, Becky. It sounds like this has been a challenging journey for you. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings of self-doubt first started and how they\u2019ve changed over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started a few years ago, maybe around 2021. At first, I\u2019d just feel a little uneasy after social media arguments where people dismissed comic art as 'not real work.' But over time, those fleeting doubts became this constant hum in my head. Last year especially, comparing my passion to friends\u2019 corporate jobs or my sister\u2019s \u2018practical\u2019 career\u2014like she\u2019s some CEO\u2014made me question if I was just\u2026 wasting time. Now, even when I draw, I\u2019m half-convinced I should be doing something 'better' with my hours. It\u2019s like the doubt follows me into my own creative space, and that\u2019s crushing."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the doubt has become a heavy presence in your creative process, making it hard to fully engage with your passion. What are you hoping therapy can help you achieve in terms of your relationship with your art and these feelings of self-doubt?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I want to stop seeing my art as \u2018not enough\u2019 compared to what society says matters. You know, I\u2019ve loved drawing since I was a kid, but lately it feels like I\u2019m just\u2026 going through the motions. If therapy could help me remember why I started creating in the first place, that\u2019d mean a lot. I also hope to figure out how to quiet this voice that says my hobbies are a waste of time\u2014especially when I\u2019m with other artists who seem so \u2018serious\u2019 about their work."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing your hopes for therapy, Becky. It\u2019s clear how deeply your passion for art is tied to your identity. To better understand how these feelings are affecting you daily, have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or energy levels since these self-doubts began?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, definitely. My mood\u2019s been... lower overall, like a constant cloud hanging over me. I used to get so excited about my art, but now it feels like a chore. I\u2019ve also had trouble sleeping\u2014sometimes I lie awake for hours thinking about whether my work even matters. And when I do sleep, I wake up tired. My energy\u2019s worse too; even sketching for an hour leaves me drained. I\u2019ve canceled plans with friends a few times because I just couldn\u2019t muster the motivation to leave the house."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight of these doubts has made even your creative process feel burdensome, which must be exhausting. Can you share a bit about what you\u2019ve tried so far to manage these feelings\u2014whether things that have helped, or strategies that might have made things harder?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve tried telling myself that creating comics should be about joy, not validation, but the doubt still creeps in. I once forced myself to sketch daily for a month, thinking routine would help, but it felt like pushing through mud\u2014it just made me hate drawing more. My friends who get it try to encourage me, but honestly, most people just say things like, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a \u2018real\u2019 job?\u201d which\u2026 yeah, that doesn\u2019t help. I think I\u2019m running out of options, which is why I\u2019m here."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to understand if there have been any difficult or challenging experiences in your life that might be impacting how you feel about your art or yourself. Would you be comfortable sharing about that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Those online arguments from 2021 really shook me. People called comic art '\u5e7c\u7a1a' or said it wasn't 'real' work, which made me second-guess everything. Then, seeing my sister climb the corporate ladder while I... well, while I'm drawing superheroes in my pajamas? It's hard to ignore that contrast. I keep thinking, 'Am I just... wasting my potential?'"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure we address any urgent concerns. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if only in passing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself. But sometimes the emotional weight feels overwhelming, like I can't escape this doubt that I'm just... wasting my time on something 'childish' instead of doing something 'real.'"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to conform to certain expectations has been really heavy on your creative spirit. Let\u2019s shift focus slightly\u2014have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently, either to cope or for other reasons?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I haven\u2019t really changed my habits with alcohol or anything else. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes when I\u2019m too overwhelmed to sleep, but nothing heavy or regular. I don\u2019t want to rely on that\u2014it just makes the guilt worse. I\u2019ve never used cannabis or other things, but I\u2019ve thought about it... even though part of me says it would just feed the self-doubt."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you\u2019ve been managing without turning to substances for relief. Let\u2019s explore a few more areas to ensure we\u2019re addressing all factors. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or had a lot of ideas coming at once?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced that. Lately, I\u2019ve actually been feeling the opposite\u2014like I can\u2019t even muster the energy to start drawing sometimes. Before 2021, there were definitely bursts of creativity, but those feel forced now. Now it\u2019s more like dragging myself to sketch for 30 minutes feels like climbing a mountain."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts or perceptions, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual or hard to let go of, even when others disagree?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't heard voices or seen things that others don't. But... the negative thoughts about my work feel almost like an unshakable belief. Like I keep telling myself my passion is frivolous, even when friends say they enjoy my art. It\u2019s hard to explain\u2014those doubts have become this automatic filter, making me question every choice related to my creativity."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like those persistent doubts are deeply tied to your creative identity. Let\u2019s check a few more things to ensure we have a complete picture\u2014could you share if you\u2019re currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I'm not taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly. My health hasn't been a big issue, so I haven't needed any of those. I do try to eat well most days, but that's about it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your energy challenges are deeply tied to your creative process. Let\u2019s briefly check for any underlying medical factors\u2014have you noticed any conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might contribute to your fatigue or mood?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with any of those physical conditions. But I *have* been struggling with sleep\u2014mostly waking up in the middle of the night, which probably contributes to the tiredness. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s stress or something else, though."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Based on our discussion, it sounds like your self-doubt about comic art began after 2021 online criticism labeled it as '\u5e7c\u7a1a,' which collided with long-standing comparisons to your sister\u2019s corporate success. This created a cycle where societal pressures and internalized guilt about 'wasting time' now make creative work feel burdensome, even though you still doodle and seek help to reconnect with your passion. Does this capture your experience accurately, or would you like to adjust anything?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that\u2019s pretty much it. The 2021 criticism felt like a punch to the gut\u2014I\u2019d never questioned my art before, but suddenly people called it \u2018\u5e7c\u7a1a,\u2019 which I took to mean \u2018childish\u2019 or not serious. Comparing myself to my sister\u2019s corporate ladder just made it worse; I felt like I was failing at both \u2018real success\u2019 and my own passion. Now, even when I doodle, there\u2019s this nagging voice that says, \u2018You\u2019re just wasting time,\u2019 and it\u2019s exhausting. The guilt\u2019s like a loop, and I can\u2019t seem to turn it off."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for a long time, Becky\u2014your resilience in keeping creative despite the exhaustion is something we can build on. Let me briefly outline a model of what\u2019s been going on: Predisposing factors might include your deep connection to art as identity, while the 2021 criticism acted as a precipitating event. Perpetuating factors could be the relentless self-criticism and comparisons, while protective factors include your proactive help-seeking and continued doodling. Does this framework make sense, or would you add\/correct anything?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The framework makes sense, though I\u2019d add that the persistent invalidation from others\u2014like people saying my work isn\u2019t \u2018real\u2019\u2014fuels the self-criticism. Also, the sleeplessness feels like it\u2019s looping me back into the same tired, negative cycles every night."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how invalidation from others and sleep disturbances are intensifying the cycle of self-criticism. Let me update the model to include these: the external invalidation (e.g., 'not real work') and sleeplessness are now key perpetuating factors. Does this revised framework feel accurate, or is there more to add? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that feels right. I think what\u2019s missing is how my self-worth feels tied to my art. When I doubt it, I start questioning *myself*\u2014like if I\u2019m \u2018failing\u2019 at life because I\u2019m not \u2018serious.\u2019 Also, the fear that others might see my passion as childish, not just dismissive comments\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of proving it\u2019s valid while it\u2019s draining me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s clear how deeply tied your self-worth is to your creative output, and how the fear of invalidation amplifies the emotional weight you\u2019re carrying. To recap: Our model includes predisposing factors (art as identity), precipitating events (2021 criticism and sibling comparisons), perpetuating factors (self-criticism, sleeplessness, external invalidation), and protective factors (proactive help-seeking, doodling resilience). What did I miss, or is there anything you\u2019d adjust before we discuss next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Your model is pretty spot-on, but maybe the part about \u2018doodling resilience\u2019 feels a bit small. When I\u2019m sketching randomly in my notebook, even if it\u2019s messy, it\u2019s like a tiny rebellion against the voice that says my work doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s the only thing that still feels mine. Also, the sibling comparisons\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about her success. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t get that my art *is* my success, but I can\u2019t explain it without sounding\u2026\u5e7c\u7a1a, to use that word against myself. Maybe that\u2019s part of the perpetuating cycle too\u2014the shame of not being understood."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how doodling is both a rebellion and a lifeline for you, Becky. What do you think would help us start untangling this loop of self-criticism and rekindle the sense of ownership you described in your doodling?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I think starting would mean letting go of the pressure to make every piece \u2018count\u2019 as something big. For years, I tied my worth to how \u2018serious\u2019 my art was seen as, but when I doodle without that weight\u2014like the superhero in pajamas sketches\u2014it feels like I\u2019m just... being me again. Maybe if I could focus on that joy first, instead of fixing what I think others want, it might quiet the voice that says I\u2019m wasting time. But it\u2019s hard; that voice is loud, especially when I scroll through social media and compare myself to others."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your insight about how unstructured doodling reclaims your sense of self\u2014let\u2019s build on that. If we set a goal to explore creative practices that prioritize joy over productivity, while also addressing the sleep and social media cycles that amplify self-criticism, would that feel like a manageable next step? Is there anything else we haven\u2019t covered that matters to you right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That sounds manageable, but the self-criticism is so automatic now\u2014it\u2019s like a broken record. Even trying to doodle feels like I\u2019m \u2018supposed\u2019 to create something \u2018good,\u2019 so I freeze. And the social media part\u2026 every scroll feels like another reminder that my work isn\u2019t \u2018enough\u2019 compared to others. Also, the sleep thing\u2026 I\u2019ve been waking up at 3 a.m. staring at the ceiling, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the anxiety or just bad habits from late-night scrolling. Is it okay if I take this one step at a time?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s understandable that the self-criticism feels so entrenched\u2014it\u2019s like trying to quiet a storm that\u2019s been raging for years. Let me propose a tentative next step plan: We could start by experimenting with small, joy-focused creative exercises (like your superhero-in-pajamas doodles) to rebuild confidence, while also exploring strategies to limit social media\u2019s impact and address the 3 a.m. rumination cycle. Would this feel like a reasonable starting point, and is there anything else you\u2019d want to prioritize first?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The plan sounds reasonable, especially the part about the superhero doodles\u2014they\u2019re the one thing I still laugh at sometimes. I guess I could try smaller exercises to ease back in... though the 3 a.m. rumination is tough. Sometimes I lie there thinking about my sister\u2019s LinkedIn posts and wondering if I\u2019m just... stuck in a fantasy. Could we also talk about how to stop that voice from winning at night? It\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t let me rest."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m glad the plan resonates, and I appreciate your honesty about the 3 a.m. rumination\u2014it\u2019s valid to feel overwhelmed by it. Let\u2019s make addressing that part of our next steps. Before we finalize, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust in this plan to ensure it feels right for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think focusing on practical ways to quiet that critical voice when I create would help\u2014like affirmations or grounding techniques. Also, maybe exploring how to set boundaries with comparisons to my sister or others, since that feels like a big weight. Oh, and the sleep thing\u2014waking at 3 a.m. with these spiraling thoughts\u2014if we could work on that rhythm, it might untangle some of the exhaustion fueling the doubt."}
