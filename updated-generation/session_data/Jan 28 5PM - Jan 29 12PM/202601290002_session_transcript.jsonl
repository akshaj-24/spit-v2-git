{"role":"interviewer","content":"Rebecca, is there a preferred pronoun I should use when referring to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"She"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that, Rebecca. It's important to establish a comfortable environment for our discussion. Today's session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we can work together to address them. The session will last about 50 minutes. Does that sound okay with you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that sounds okay. I just... hope we can figure some things out. It\u2019s been hard not knowing what to do next."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense to want clarity when things feel uncertain. Before we move forward, is there anything specific you'd like to ask about how our sessions work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what to expect. I guess I wonder if we\u2019ll just talk about my problems, or if there will be exercises or something? I hope it doesn\u2019t feel too... rigid. I just want to feel like I can actually work through these thoughts."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the hopelessness you're experiencing has been deeply impactful. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings first began and how they've changed since you dropped out of college?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The hopelessness really kicked in around the time I dropped out of college. At first, it felt like a wave of stress about my future, but it\u2019s turned into this constant ache. Even when I try to focus on hobbies or hang out with friends, the thought that I\u2019ll never find love or feel secure in my path just creeps back in. It\u2019s like the stress from dropping out never fully went away\u2014it just morphed into this deeper, more everyday kind of despair."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m really listening to how this ongoing despair feels like it\u2019s taken root in your daily life. Can you share if there have been changes in your sleep or energy levels since these feelings started intensifying?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah... I\u2019ve been having trouble falling asleep most nights. My mind just replays these thoughts about being alone forever, even when I\u2019m exhausted. And when I do sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven\u2019t rested at all. My energy\u2019s been... really low. Some days, getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. I\u2019ll start brushing my teeth or something, and just collapse back down because it all feels pointless."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the effort to get through daily tasks has been incredibly draining, and the weight of these thoughts follows you even when you try to rest. What would you most hope to achieve through therapy right now\u2014what kind of changes or support would feel meaningful for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I really want to stop feeling like there\u2019s no future for me, you know? It\u2019s hard to even try to take care of myself when I\u2019m stuck thinking I\u2019ll always be alone. I\u2019d like to learn how to believe that maybe things can get better, even if it\u2019s hard to imagine right now."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the stress of dropping out of college and feeling uncertain about your future has significantly impacted your emotional well-being. To better understand your situation, could you share if there were any other difficult experiences or challenges in your past that might have contributed to these feelings of hopelessness?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think there were other big struggles before this\u2014most of my life, I managed to keep going even when things felt hard. My family moved a few times when I was a teenager, which made it tricky to hold onto friendships, but I always told myself that was just \u2018how life goes.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really connect how that drifting sense of not belonging might have stuck with me. This current despair feels\u2026 newer, sharper. Like the moving was background noise, but dropping out of college was the first time I actually felt like I was falling apart."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's understandable how the moves during your teens and the recent college experience could contribute to feelings of not belonging. Have there been any other challenging or difficult experiences in your life that you think might be relevant to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think... the moving around when I was younger didn\u2019t help. I changed schools so much that I never really got to stay friends with people. It felt like I was always starting over, and that made me scared to get close to anyone in case they left. Now, even when I try to make friends or... or think about relationships, part of me expects everyone to drift away eventually. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve trained myself to believe no one will stick around."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the fear of people leaving is really impacting your ability to form close relationships now. Can you tell me about any friends or family members you feel you can rely on, even if they aren't physically close?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My family lives in another state, and while we talk occasionally, it\u2019s hard to stay close. My younger sister used to be my main support, but we\u2019ve drifted apart since I dropped out of college. I have a friend from college I used to confide in, but we don\u2019t talk much anymore\u2014I guess I just don\u2019t know how to rebuild those connections now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s understandable how past experiences of moving and losing connections could shape fears about relationships. Have there been any other challenging experiences, even from earlier in your life, that you think might have influenced your current feelings about relationships or your sense of self-worth?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I moved a lot as a kid\u2014like, every few years my family would up and leave for a new state. It got old real fast. I never had time to make real friends or feel like I belonged anywhere. My parents were always stressed about work, so I learned to keep to myself... but I guess part of me still craves that sense of being seen or connected, you know? It's hard to explain, but I feel like I'm just... not enough for anyone."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing about the challenges with moving and feeling unseen. It can be really hard when we feel disconnected from others. Would you be comfortable sharing if there have been any other experiences, perhaps involving safety or emotional harm, that you think might be relevant to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don't recall any specific experiences involving safety or direct emotional harm beyond what I've already shared. The feelings of hopelessness have been new since dropping out of college, though\u2014it's like the weight of that decision turned into this constant ache about never having a future or being loved. I guess that's... that's the main thing I'm trying to work through here."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing your feelings of hopelessness and the challenges you've faced. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in any way?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had specific thoughts about ending my life, but the pain of feeling unlovable and stuck feels unbearable sometimes. It\u2019s like a heavy weight I carry, and there are days when I wonder if this despair will ever lift."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m glad to hear you haven\u2019t had specific thoughts about ending your life. Let\u2019s explore some other aspects of your current experience. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed very little sleep, or had racing thoughts that were hard to control?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. My sleep issues are more about lying awake worrying about being alone forever, not feeling energized or unable to stop my thoughts. The exhaustion I feel is from the weight of these hopeless thoughts, not from restlessness or overactivity."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for clarifying. Let\u2019s move to another important area. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past month, including for coping with stress or sleep issues?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used any substances in the past month. I\u2019ve mostly just tried to cope with stress by distracting myself with hobbies, but it\u2019s not really working. My sleep problems are still bad, though\u2014I just lie awake thinking about being alone forever."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m sorry to hear that your sleep remains so challenging\u2014it sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently that feel unsettling or out of the ordinary?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hallucinations or paranoid thoughts. But the intrusive thoughts about being alone forever feel... vivid sometimes, like they\u2019re pressing down on me even when I\u2019m trying to sleep. It\u2019s more like my mind won\u2019t stop replaying the same fears."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. Let\u2019s briefly check on medications\u2014could you tell me if you\u2019re currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter supplements, or herbal remedies, including for sleep or anxiety?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I'm not currently taking any prescription medications, supplements, or herbal remedies. I haven't needed anything like that before, though I\u2019ve thought about trying melatonin for the sleep issues sometimes. But I never ended up buying it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m hearing how heavy these thoughts feel, especially at night when there\u2019s nowhere to put them. Let\u2019s check on one more thing\u2014do you have anything in your life that helps you feel even a little more grounded or hopeful, even if just for a moment? It could be a person, a hobby, or even a small ritual."}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, sometimes I draw or write in my journal just to have something to focus on. It doesn\u2019t really make the sadness go away, but it... it gives me a tiny break from the loop of thinking I\u2019m stuck in. Even if I don\u2019t feel hopeful, at least I\u2019m not completely numb while I\u2019m doing it."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"To recap, we've explored how your hopelessness began after college, intensified by fears of unlovability and isolation, and how childhood instability may contribute to these feelings. We also discussed how sleep disturbances and low energy are impacting your daily life, alongside your creative efforts to cope. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You covered most of it, but I\u2019d add that my sister and the friend I had in college drifting away made me feel even more unseen. Also, the part about fearing people leaving me stems from moving a lot as a teen, which you mentioned, but it\u2019s hard to explain how that ties to now\u2014like, even if I could open up, I worry they\u2019ll vanish too. Oh, and you didn\u2019t mention how my self-care has slipped; some days I skip basic things like showering because it all feels pointless."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing those additional details\u2014loss of close relationships and declining self-care are important pieces of the picture. To ensure we\u2019re aligned, let me briefly recap: Your hopelessness began after college, intensified by fears of abandonment rooted in childhood instability, and is now compounded by strained relationships and neglecting self-care. We\u2019ve also discussed how sleep and energy issues are affecting your daily life. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Your summary is pretty accurate\u2014I think you captured the main points. Maybe just to add, the creative stuff like drawing or journaling does help a little, but it\u2019s fleeting. And the isolation from family and friends makes it harder to even try reaching out sometimes. Other than that, I think you got it right."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for those additions\u2014creative outlets offering temporary relief and isolation complicating connection attempts are both critical. To frame this, let\u2019s consider a simple model: Your hopelessness began after college (a key stressor), is fueled by fears of abandonment (linked to childhood moves and strained relationships now), and is worsened by low energy and self-care neglect. Protective factors include your creative resilience and desire for therapy. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You captured the main points well, but maybe missed how the moving as a teen created a lasting 'I don\u2019t belong' feeling that still makes me fear people will leave. Also, my family\u2019s distance isn\u2019t just \u2018strained relationships\u2019\u2014we\u2019re literally 1,500 miles apart, and calls feel forced. And while creative outlets *do* offer brief connection-feeling moments, they also highlight how lonely I am when the relief fades. Otherwise, your summary feels accurate\u2014thank you for getting the core of it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for those clarifications\u2014the distance from family and the lingering 'I don\u2019t belong' feeling are significant, and I appreciate you sharing how creative outlets both help and highlight your loneliness. To move forward, what would you feel most comfortable prioritizing in our next steps? For example, would you prefer to explore strategies for building connection despite fear of abandonment, address sleep patterns first, or something else entirely?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think exploring how to build connection despite fearing abandonment might be most important\u2014relationships are such a big part of why I feel stuck. I\u2019ve carried this belief that I\u2019m not enough for anyone, and it\u2019s hard to even try to get close. But I also wonder if addressing the sleep would help... when I\u2019m so exhausted from these thoughts, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t even start working on anything else. Maybe... maybe we could look at both? Like, tackle small steps for forming connections while also finding ways to quiet my mind at night. That way, I\u2019m not so drained all the time."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Patient reports persistent hopelessness since college dropout, with sleep disturbances (difficulty falling\/asleep, non-restorative sleep), low energy, and impaired daily functioning (e.g., neglecting self-care like showering). Fears of abandonment linked to childhood instability (frequent family moves) and recent strained relationships (distant family, drifting friendships). Notable quote: 'It\u2019s like the stress from dropping out never fully went away\u2014it just morphed into this deeper, more everyday kind of despair.'\n\nObjective: Reports of functional decline in self-care and social engagement. History of childhood relocation instability (every few years), contributing to chronic fear of disconnection. No acute safety risk; denies suicidal ideation or substance use in past month. Uses creative outlets (drawing, journaling) for brief emotional respite.\n\nAssessment: Depressive symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disruption) with underlying anxiety around abandonment. Chronic relational insecurity rooted in childhood attachment disruptions. Elevated risk for isolation-related symptom exacerbation. No acute suicidality or substance use.\n\nPlan: Prioritize CBT strategies for abandonment fears and social connection-building, alongside sleep hygiene interventions. Monitor functional decline (self-care neglect). Explore adaptive coping beyond creative outlets. Address family communication barriers (distance, strained dynamics).\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
