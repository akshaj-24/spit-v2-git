{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Delaney, thank you for coming in today. To start, can you share your name and pronouns with me?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Hi, my name is Delaney Collins, and my pronouns are she\/her."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you, Delaney. Today, we'll be discussing your concerns and working together to understand what's going on. How does that sound?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That sounds good. I\u2019ve been feeling really overwhelmed about the dog at the shelter not getting adopted, and it\u2019s been affecting my life a lot lately. I\u2019m not sure where to start, but I want to work through it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that, Delaney. It sounds like this has been really heavy on your mind. Are you comfortable proceeding with this discussion today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I think it's important to address this because it's really affecting my studies and I can't seem to shake the guilt. It's hard to explain to my friends how I feel about the whole situation."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by these feelings. Do you have any questions about how this process works or anything else before we start?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think I understand. I\u2019m here to talk through it and figure out how to manage these feelings. I guess I just want to understand why I\u2019m taking this so personally, even though I know I\u2019m not responsible for the dog\u2019s adoption."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this guilt has been really heavy to carry. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started feeling this way and if there was anything specific that made it worse recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started about a month ago when the dog, a black lab named Max, didn\u2019t get adopted during the last adoption event. I\u2019d bonded with him because he was shy, and I spent extra time socializing him. When he was still there after the event, I kept thinking maybe I hadn\u2019t done enough to help him. Recently, during a staff meeting, I overheard someone say they weren\u2019t sure if Max was \u2018shelter-friendly\u2019\u2014it felt like a reflection on my work with him, even though I know that\u2019s not fair. It just\u2026 piled on the guilt."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this situation has been really weighing on you. Can you share an example of how this has affected your schoolwork or your interactions with friends recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, last week I had a major presentation for my anatomy class, but I kept zoning out during practice because I kept thinking about the dog still at the shelter. I got a B instead of an A, and my study group kept asking if I was okay, which made me snap at them. I feel bad afterward, but the guilt about the dog just... it\u2019s always there, you know? It\u2019s like I can\u2019t focus on anything without that weight pulling me under."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that vulnerable moment\u2014it sounds like a lot to carry alone. Looking ahead, what would you most hope to achieve through our work together? How would \u2018getting better\u2019 look to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I guess I just want to stop feeling like this is my fault. I don\u2019t want to keep thinking I\u2019m a \u2018bad volunteer\u2019 or that my extra hours are even helping\u2026 I know logically that adoption depends on a lot of things, but I can\u2019t shake the guilt. If this gets better, I\u2019d hope to walk into the shelter without my chest tightening, and actually focus on my classes again. Maybe I need to learn when to let go of things I can\u2019t control."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much this situation is affecting your life, and it\u2019s brave to share these thoughts. You mentioned in your intake that your sleep has been affected\u2014could you tell me a bit more about how that\u2019s been showing up for you lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s been really tough. I\u2019ll lie awake at night thinking I must\u2019ve done something wrong to keep the dog from getting adopted, like maybe I didn\u2019t socialize it enough or something. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and feel this wave of guilt, then I can\u2019t go back to sleep. I\u2019ve been tired all the time, which makes it harder to focus on my classes."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to ask if there have been any other difficult or traumatic experiences in your life that might be related to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Not that I can think of\u2014nothing like this has happened before. I\u2019ve always been pretty driven, maybe a perfectionist, but this feels different. It\u2019s like my usual stress just... intensified over something I can\u2019t control. Even my friends are surprised by how much this is getting to me."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you experienced any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, Delaney? If so, could you share how often these thoughts occur and if they include a specific plan or method?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. The guilt and stress have been really tough, but I haven\u2019t gone that far. I just want to stop feeling so overwhelmed and regain control over my emotions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty, Delaney. It sounds like the guilt has been really heavy to carry. Let\u2019s shift focus slightly\u2014have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns that feel different from usual? For example, feeling unusually restless, wired, or needing less sleep than typical?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, my sleep has been off. I lie awake at night replaying my \"mistakes\" with Max, then wake up exhausted but still wired. It\u2019s like my brain can\u2019t shut off the guilt, even when I\u2019m physically tired."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how your sleep has been affected\u2014it sounds incredibly draining. Let\u2019s explore a bit further: Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels, such as feeling more restless, needing less sleep, or taking risks you wouldn\u2019t normally take?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I haven\u2019t noticed any changes in needing less sleep or feeling unusually restless, but I\u2019ve definitely been more fatigued lately. My brain feels foggy even after a full night\u2019s sleep\u2014though, honestly, I rarely get that anymore. I do miss the energy I used to have for studying, but I haven\u2019t taken any risks or acted impulsively. It\u2019s more like\u2026 my usual drive is there, but it\u2019s drowned out by this guilt."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how the guilt has affected your energy and focus. To continue, have you experienced any hallucinations (like hearing voices or seeing things others don\u2019t), delusions (strong beliefs that feel real but aren\u2019t), or paranoia (fear someone is targeting you) related to this stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hallucinations or delusions. I do sometimes feel overwhelmed, like the guilt is suffocating, but it\u2019s not about hearing voices or seeing things. The paranoia part\u2014I guess I worry people might think I\u2019m failing as a volunteer, but it\u2019s more about my own self-judgment than fearing someone is targeting me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you clarifying that, Delaney. It sounds like the guilt is really weighing on you emotionally. Let\u2019s move forward: Have you used any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or others recently, or noticed any changes in use that might be connected to how you\u2019re feeling?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used any substances like alcohol or cannabis recently. I\u2019ve actually been avoiding them because I want to stay focused on my studies and volunteering. My friends sometimes suggest going out to unwind, but I decline since I feel I need to keep my priorities straight right now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your commitment to staying focused on your priorities, Delaney. To ensure we cover all bases, could you share if you\u2019re currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins? If so, how have they been working for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not currently taking any medications or supplements. I do take a daily vitamin D pill because I\u2019m indoors a lot for school and volunteering, but it\u2019s just a basic one from the pharmacy."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the emotional toll this is taking. To ensure we address all potential factors, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a head injury that might be affecting your mood or energy levels?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. But I have mentioned my sleep problems\u2014lying awake at night worrying about Max, waking up exhausted, and struggling to focus during the day. I know the sleep issues are tied to the stress and guilt, though, not an underlying condition."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about the connection between stress and your sleep patterns. To ensure we\u2019ve covered all aspects of your well-being, could you share any supports or resources (like friends, activities, or coping strategies) that have helped you manage stress or stay grounded in challenging moments?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My friends try to support me by checking in, but they don\u2019t fully grasp how much this weighs on me. I\u2019ve also been throwing myself into volunteer work\u2014like staying extra hours at the shelter or cleaning cages\u2014to feel like I\u2019m \u2018earning\u2019 Max\u2019s chance at adoption. It\u2019s\u2026 not really working, but it\u2019s all I can think to do. Sometimes I\u2019ll force myself to study harder too, like if I get a good grade, maybe it\u2019ll balance out the guilt somehow."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Based on our discussion, it sounds like your current stress and guilt stem from taking on responsibility for Max's adoption, which may be linked to your perfectionist tendencies (predisposing), the recent staff comment about Max (precipitating), and ongoing patterns of self-blame and overworking to 'earn' adoption chances (perpetuating). Your proactive approach to therapy and social support are protective factors. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is unfolding for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You captured the main points well, but maybe missed how the staff comment about Max being 'not shelter-friendly' felt like a personal failure, like they were judging my volunteer work. Also, I haven\u2019t mentioned how my perfectionism makes me over-identify with animals\u2014I think I take their 'unadoptable' labels as a reflection of my own worth, even if that\u2019s irrational. The academic impact is worse than just one grade; I\u2019ve been zoning out in lectures too, which is scary for my med school chances."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing those important nuances about the staff comment and how your perfectionism intertwines with Max\u2019s situation. What else might I have missed about how this is affecting you or what you need moving forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think another thing is how this guilt is making me question if I'm cut out for medicine. If I can't even help Max, what if I fail patients someday? It's like the fear of being 'unreliable' or 'not enough' is creeping into my career identity now. I need to untangle my self-worth from outcomes I can't control. Also, maybe learning how to set healthier boundaries between my roles at the shelter and school before it all collapses."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing those important insights about your career identity and boundaries. It seems like we\u2019ve covered the key factors contributing to your distress\u2014your perfectionism, the staff comment about Max, and the fear of failure in medicine. What else might I have missed about how this is affecting you or what you need to move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think what\u2019s missing is how this guilt is making me second-guess my whole approach to helping others. I\u2019ve always believed that if I work hard enough, I can fix things\u2014but Max\u2019s situation makes me wonder if I\u2019m just\u2026 not cut out for roles where I need to make a difference. I\u2019m scared that this fear of failing to \u2018save\u2019 someone might follow me into my medical career. I need to learn how to accept that not every outcome is in my control without it meaning I\u2019m a bad person or volunteer. Also, I\u2019m realizing I don\u2019t know how to ask for help with this\u2014my instinct is to power through, but that\u2019s clearly not working."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how deeply this experience has challenged your sense of purpose and self-worth, and your courage in naming these fears is a meaningful step. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing these concerns\u2014exploring strategies to manage guilt, practicing self-compassion, or setting boundaries between your roles at the shelter and school?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think the most urgent is learning strategies to manage the guilt because it\u2019s the core of my struggle. I\u2019ve been tying my self-worth to Max\u2019s adoption, but I need tools to reframe that\u2014like recognizing I can\u2019t control outcomes. Once I have those strategies, I could build self-compassion, but right now, the guilt feels like a loop I can\u2019t escape. I also wonder if setting clearer boundaries between the shelter and school would help prevent my stress from spilling into everything, but I\u2019m not sure how to start that yet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for clarifying the urgency around guilt management\u2014it\u2019s clear how deeply this is affecting your life right now. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust about the plan we\u2019ve discussed (e.g., strategies for guilt, boundaries, career concerns)?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think the plan is a good start, but maybe I need to clarify how to balance my responsibilities. I worry that focusing on my guilt will make me neglect my studies, but I also fear overworking at the shelter to \u2018fix\u2019 this. Could we add strategies to set boundaries between volunteering and school? Also, I\u2019m nervous about how this might affect my future as a doctor\u2014I don\u2019t want perfectionism to define my career too. I\u2019d like tools to reframe my self-judgment about control versus responsibility."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for articulating those priorities so clearly. To recap: We\u2019ve identified guilt management as the urgent focus, with strategies to reframe self-judgment and boundaries between roles as key next steps. You also want to address career-related fears about perfectionism. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is unfolding for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You captured the main points well, but the comment about Max being 'unshelter-friendly' really hit me hard\u2014it felt like validation that my efforts were pointless. Also, the academic slip-up during the presentation (zoning out and getting a lower grade) is a specific example of how this guilt is spilling into my studies. I think my overworking at the shelter to 'earn' Max\u2019s chance is another part of this cycle I need help breaking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for adding those important details about the staff comment and academic impact. To ensure we\u2019re aligned: Our focus will be on guilt management strategies to break the cycle of self-blame, boundary-setting between your roles, and addressing career-related fears. Is there anything else I\u2019ve missed about your experience or priorities that should shape our plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Thank you\u2014I think that covers it. Maybe it\u2019s also worth noting how my perfectionism ties into this? I\u2019ve always felt I need to be \u2018perfect\u2019 to succeed in medicine, so Max\u2019s lack of adoption feels like a personal failure in a role I care deeply about. I worry this pattern might repeat in my future career if I can\u2019t learn to separate outcomes from my worth. Also, the overworking\u2014volunteering extra hours or cramming study sessions\u2014might be my way of trying to \u2018fix\u2019 things, but it\u2019s just making the guilt worse. I\u2019d like to address that cycle too."}
