{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hayden, to start, could you share your preferred name and pronouns if you're comfortable?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name is Hayden, and I use she\/her pronouns."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that, Hayden. Do you have any questions about how this session will go or what we might discuss today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t have specific questions, but I\u2019m open to discussing what\u2019s needed to help. I just hope we can figure out why these doubts keep coming up even when I try to push through."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that persistent doubts can feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to push through. Would you be comfortable continuing with our conversation today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I guess so... I mean, it\u2019s kind of hard to talk about this stuff, but I wanted to get better. I just hope we can figure out why I can\u2019t even enjoy gaming anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for your courage in sharing this, Hayden. Just to confirm, are you comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I'm okay with moving forward. It's a bit uncomfortable talking about this, but I want to work through it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense to want to address these challenges. Just to confirm, you understand this session will involve exploring your experiences with gaming-related doubts and discussing how we might work together, correct?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that sounds right. I guess I just want to figure out why I can\u2019t shake these feelings about Fortnite. It\u2019s starting to make me question other things too, like if I\u2019m just... not good at sticking with anything."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It takes courage to share these thoughts, Hayden. Is there anything specific you'd like to clarify or ask about before we move forward today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Thanks... I think I just wanted to make sure this is a safe space where I can talk without judgment. To be honest, I\u2019m nervous, but I\u2019m ready to work on this. I guess I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll also touch on how these feelings affect my confidence beyond Fortnite?"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s encouraging to hear you\u2019re motivated to work through this. What would you most hope to achieve through counseling, Hayden?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I guess I want to figure out how to stop letting these feelings ruin my confidence\u2014not just in gaming but in other areas too. I\u2019d also hope to find a way to play Fortnite without dreading it or feeling like I\u2019m going to fail before I even start. It\u2019s just\u2026 frustrating to let something like this take up so much space in my head when I know I should be able to just enjoy it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014it takes courage to acknowledge how something is affecting so many areas. Can you tell me a bit more about when these feelings first started and how they\u2019ve changed over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess it started a few months ago when I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t get better at Fortnite no matter how much I practiced. My friends kept talking about their progress, and I felt like I was falling behind. At first, it was frustrating, but now it\u2019s worse\u2014I don\u2019t even want to play anymore because I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll just fail again. The doubts used to only pop up when I was playing, but now they follow me even when I\u2019m thinking about it casually, like when people mention it. I tried breaking it into smaller goals, like just surviving one round, but I still end up putting the game down and not trying again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this has been really draining, Hayden\u2014thank you for sharing so openly. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels since these feelings started?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling more anxious and drained lately, especially when I think about gaming or see others play. It\u2019s like my energy dips whenever I encounter Fortnite-related stuff, even if I\u2019m just scrolling through social media."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s understandable how that energy drain could feel overwhelming. You mentioned trying to set small goals in the game\u2014have there been other strategies you\u2019ve used to cope with these feelings, either ones that helped or maybe made things feel harder?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I tried taking breaks from gaming to reset my mind, but that just made me feel like I was avoiding the problem. I also used to watch my friends play Fortnite to learn from them, but it ended up making me feel even more inadequate. Those moments would leave me frustrated, like I was stuck in this loop of wanting to get better but not knowing how to start without failing again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the frustration of feeling stuck is really weighing on you\u2014thank you for sharing that vulnerability. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or concentration since these feelings started, even if small?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I haven't noticed major changes in my sleep or concentration, but sometimes I'll lie awake thinking about how I 'should' be better at Fortnite or catch myself zoning out during other games because my mind keeps circling back to it. It's not constant, though\u2014I can still focus on schoolwork when I need to."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your friends are a source of support even if you haven\u2019t shared these specific feelings with them yet. Can you tell me about any other experiences in your life\u2014academic, social, or otherwise\u2014that might have shaped how you view challenges or setbacks, either positively or negatively?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I\u2019ve never struggled like this before\u2014I\u2019ve always been able to work through challenges, especially in school. But with Fortnite, it\u2019s different. I guess it\u2019s frustrating because I compare myself to friends who just *get* it, making me feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me specifically. I don\u2019t want to give up, but it\u2019s like my brain keeps hitting a wall it can\u2019t climb. That fear of failure feels\u2026 louder here than anywhere else, even though I handle stress okay in other areas."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to keep up with friends and the fear of failure in Fortnite are really weighing on you. Have you experienced any past situations or challenges that might be contributing to these feelings of self-doubt or anxiety?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don't think so... At least, not in my memory. But maybe I\u2019ve always been a bit of a perfectionist in small ways. Like, in middle school I would stress over grades even when I was doing fine. But with Fortnite, it\u2019s different\u2014there\u2019s this constant comparison to friends who seem to pick it up faster. I guess I just fear... that if I can\u2019t master it, I\u2019m somehow not \u2018trying hard enough\u2019?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me a bit about your family environment during middle school? Were there any expectations or dynamics that might have contributed to that perfectionist mindset?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My family environment during middle school was... pretty standard, I guess? My parents were supportive but definitely had high expectations, especially academically. I remember feeling like I had to be \u2018on\u2019 all the time, like if I didn\u2019t get straight A\u2019s or excel in extracurriculars, I\u2019d let them down. There wasn\u2019t any direct pressure about gaming\u2014it wasn\u2019t really a thing back then\u2014but I think I internalized the idea that not being perfect meant I was failing. Like, even if I did well, I\u2019d obsess over the one grade that wasn\u2019t a 100%. Maybe that\u2019s why video games feel so... loaded now? I guess I\u2019ve always been my own worst critic."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me a bit about your family environment during middle school? Were there any expectations or dynamics that might have contributed to that perfectionist mindset?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My parents were pretty supportive overall, but I think they emphasized doing your best in everything. My mom would get upset if I didn\u2019t finish school projects perfectly, even if I said I was \u2018close enough.\u2019 There was this constant push to be the best in class, which... I guess carried over into how I approach things now. Like, if I can\u2019t master something quickly, I start thinking there\u2019s something wrong with me. It wasn\u2019t loud or harsh, but the pressure to avoid mistakes stuck with me. Fortnite just became this new arena where that old fear showed up again, maybe?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s thoughtful of you to reflect on how past experiences shape current challenges. Can you tell me about any other experiences in your life, such as difficult or challenging situations, that you think might be connected to how you're feeling about Fortnite or your confidence in general?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve dealt with anything like this before. I\u2019ve had to work hard for things\u2014like passing tough classes or learning new games\u2014where I struggled at first but eventually improved. But with Fortnite, it\u2019s different. Even when I practice, I feel like I\u2019m not getting better, and it makes me question if I\u2019m just... bad at sticking with things. It\u2019s weird because I used to be proud of my persistence, but now I\u2019m scared to even try, thinking I\u2019ll just fail again."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently? If so, can you tell me about the frequency, any plans or means you might have considered, and how you feel about following through?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. My frustration is more about feeling stuck in this cycle of self-doubt with Fortnite, not about wanting to hurt myself. I\u2019m trying to work through it here, but the stress is definitely frustrating."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I'm glad to hear you're not experiencing thoughts of self-harm. Let's talk about your energy levels. Have you noticed any recent changes in your sleep patterns, energy levels, or a sense of restlessness or overactivity that might interfere with your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My sleep has been a bit off lately. I\u2019ll lie awake thinking about how I should be better at Fortnite, which makes it hard to fall asleep sometimes. It\u2019s not constant, but those nights feel exhausting. I don\u2019t notice huge changes in my energy during the day, but I get this restless feeling when I\u2019m around the game\u2014like my brain is racing even if I\u2019m just scrolling through a forum post about it. It\u2019s not stopping me from doing schoolwork or stuff, but it\u2019s definitely wearing on me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like the game-related stress is really impacting your rest. Let's shift focus slightly\u2014have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or restless to the point of not needing much sleep, or taken risks you wouldn\u2019t normally take (like spending sprees, impulsive decisions, or rapid speech)?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve actually been on the opposite end\u2014struggling with restlessness tied to stress about Fortnite, but it\u2019s more like my mind won\u2019t shut off rather than feeling overly energetic. I tend to get drained quickly, especially when thinking about the game, so the idea of not needing sleep doesn\u2019t really fit."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for explaining how the stress affects your rest\u2014it\u2019s valid to feel worn down by persistent worries. Moving forward, have you used any substances like alcohol, cannabis, or others to cope with stress or improve your sleep? If so, how often and in what amounts?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used any substances like alcohol or cannabis to cope. I\u2019ve tried to avoid that because I don\u2019t want to add more things to feel bad about, especially since schoolwork still needs focus. Sometimes I\u2019ll just stare at the ceiling for hours trying to quiet my mind, but\u2026 it\u2019s not helping much."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s commendable that you\u2019ve avoided substances while managing this stress. Let\u2019s continue assessing your well-being\u2014have you experienced any hallucinations (seeing\/hearing things others don\u2019t), strong beliefs that seem unusual or unfounded, or thoughts that others are trying to harm you or spy on you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hallucinations or thoughts like that. But sometimes when I get really stressed about Fortnite, I\u2019ll feel overwhelmed or anxious in a way that makes my mind race\u2014like, what if I\u2019m just not cut out for this?\u2014but it\u2019s more about self-doubt than anything unusual or paranoid."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve been managing stress without turning to substances, which shows strength. Let\u2019s briefly check on medications\u2014have you been prescribed any medications or taken supplements (including vitamins, herbal remedies, etc.) recently? If so, could you share what they are and how you\u2019re using them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t been prescribed any medications or taken supplements recently. I\u2019ve mostly tried self-help strategies like setting small goals or taking breaks, but nothing medical."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve gathered so far is that your struggles with Fortnite have sparked a cycle of self-doubt, fueled by perfectionist tendencies rooted in past academic pressures. This has led to avoidance, frustration, and a dip in confidence that\u2019s spilling into other areas. We\u2019ve also noted your strengths\u2014like proactive coping and a supportive network\u2014as key tools for moving forward. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re mostly right, but I\u2019d add that my sleep\u2019s been affected too\u2014lying awake worrying about the game, even when I\u2019m not actively playing. Also, while schoolwork hasn\u2019t slipped, I get restless and mentally \u2018racing\u2019 when thinking about Fortnite, even just seeing it in forums. The small goals and breaks I tried helped a little but didn\u2019t really break the cycle. Oh, and the comparisons with friends are still a big trigger, even if my actual relationships haven\u2019t crumbled."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing those details\u2014sleep disturbances and mental restlessness are important pieces we\u2019ll address. Let me outline a brief model: Your perfectionism (predisposing) and past academic pressures likely set the stage for self-criticism. The recent plateau in Fortnite (precipitating) triggered fears of failure, which now perpetuate through avoidance and social comparisons. Protective factors include your proactive coping and supportive relationships. Does this align with your experience, or is something missing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That definitely fits what I\u2019ve been feeling\u2014like the perfectionism from my family and school is part of why this feels so personal. I guess I\u2019d add that comparing myself to friends who are good at Fortnite makes the fear of failure feel even louder. It\u2019s like their success highlights my \u2018lack of progress\u2019 more, even if we all play for fun. The model makes sense, but maybe the social comparisons are a bigger part of why I\u2019m stuck?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What would you like to focus on next in our sessions?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019d like to understand why Fortnite feels so tied to my self-worth, even though I know it\u2019s just a game. I\u2019m curious if the pressure to be \u2018good enough\u2019 from middle school somehow makes this different from other challenges I\u2019ve handled. Also, I want to figure out how to break the cycle where fear of failure makes me avoid it entirely, which just makes me feel worse. Maybe we can work on rebuilding confidence without comparing myself to others?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing your thoughtful priorities. To confirm, our next steps would involve exploring how past perfectionism intersects with your current self-worth, developing strategies to interrupt the avoidance cycle, and building confidence through non-comparative goals. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust about this plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That sounds like a solid plan. I think focusing on the perfectionism and avoidance makes sense, but I also want to work on not comparing myself to others since that really amplifies my anxiety about Fortnite."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for confirming the focus areas. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust about our next steps, or any preferences for how we approach these goals (e.g., therapy style, lifestyle strategies)?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think diving into how my perfectionism around Fortnite connects to other areas of my life would be helpful. Maybe using CBT to untangle the 'I\u2019m not good enough' thoughts when I play. Also, I\u2019d prefer a structured approach where we track small wins without making me feel like I\u2019m failing if I don\u2019t master it overnight."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing your thoughtful priorities. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust about our next steps, or any preferences for how we approach these goals (e.g., therapy style, lifestyle strategies)?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think starting with strategies to challenge my self-doubt when it comes up in Fortnite would be helpful\u2014like, maybe learning to recognize when I\u2019m comparing myself to others and how to reset that mindset. Also, I\u2019d prefer a structured approach, like CBT, since I\u2019m used to setting goals and tracking progress in school. But I\u2019m open to other methods if they\u2019d work better. Oh, and if we could also look at my sleep patterns, since the worrying about the game keeps me awake\u2026 that\u2019d probably help break the cycle."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your detailed input about CBT strategies and sleep patterns\u2014those will be key components. To ensure our plan is comprehensive, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust before we finalize our next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it\u2019s important to note how this fear of failure in Fortnite feels tied to my old habits of equating mistakes with personal flaws\u2014like how I\u2019d stress over near-perfect grades before. If we could unpack that connection, it might help me stop letting this game define my self-worth. Also, maybe we could brainstorm ways to separate 'enjoying games' from 'proving I\u2019m good at them'? I miss just playing for fun without the pressure."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for highlighting how past perfectionism shapes your current experience\u2014this connection is crucial for our work. To ensure our plan is complete, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust before we finalize our next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think we\u2019ve covered the core issues. Maybe just to clarify\u2014I want to make sure we don\u2019t overlook how this ties to my fear of being seen as \u2018not good enough\u2019 in general. Even though it\u2019s about a game, it feels like a metaphor for bigger insecurities. Also, I should mention that while I avoid Fortnite, I still check leaderboards or friend stats occasionally, which just makes me feel worse. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t even disengage fully. But other than that, I\u2019m ready to focus on strategies to break this cycle."}
