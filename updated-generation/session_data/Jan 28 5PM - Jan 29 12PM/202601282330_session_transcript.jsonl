{"role":"interviewer","content":"Good morning, Mr. Anderson. To start, can you share your preferred name and pronouns if you're comfortable?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name's Jared. I go by he\/him. I'm an IT guy, so..."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing, Jared. This session will involve discussing your concerns and working together to find ways to support you. The session will last about 50 minutes. Do you have any questions about how this will work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think I understand. I guess I'm just hoping we can work on how to stop seeing unexpected things as such a big deal. It\u2019s starting to affect my job performance, honestly."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your hope to address these challenges, Jared. Are you comfortable with us moving forward with this discussion today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I guess so... I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a better option. The whole thing about these thoughts taking up so much space in my head is starting to really wear on me, you know? Like, last week I had to work late and my plans for the evening just... vanished. I spent the whole night stewing about it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these thoughts can be really draining, Jared. Is there anything specific you'd like to clarify or discuss before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think we covered the main points. Maybe just how it's affecting work... but I'm not sure where to start."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these patterns have been with you for a long time and are starting to take a bigger toll. Can you describe how this issue has changed or evolved for you since your teenage years, especially in the past year or so?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s gotten worse over time. Back then, it was just things like canceled games or bad days at school\u2014stuff I could brush off eventually. Now, it\u2019s more about my job and expectations. If a project goes off-script or I work late like last week, I spiral into thinking the whole day is ruined, and it bleeds into weekends. The anxiety feels heavier, like I can\u2019t shake it even when I try to remind myself there\u2019s still time to enjoy things. It\u2019s starting to affect my teammates too, which makes me feel isolated and worse."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014I appreciate your openness about how this has been affecting your life. As we move forward, can you tell me what you\u2019re most hoping to achieve through counseling right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess the main thing is learning how to stop seeing every unexpected change as a total loss. I want to be able to roll with the punches without my whole day feeling ruined. Like, if a meeting gets canceled or a project shifts, I don\u2019t want to spiral into this \u2018wasted time\u2019 mindset that drags me down for hours. I\u2019m hoping we can work on practical tools\u2014maybe ways to reframe those moments or build better habits around adjusting to changes without it eating at me. My job\u2019s starting to suffer, and I don\u2019t want to be that guy who\u2019s always tense about things not going exactly as planned."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that work stress has amplified these patterns recently. Let\u2019s explore the timeline a bit more\u2014what specific changes or events in the past year do you think have made things feel more unmanageable now compared to before?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The biggest change was taking on a new project at work last year\u2014there were constant last-minute shifts in priorities, which made it hard to stick to any routine. I started staying late a lot more, and when I finally had free time, I\u2019d obsess over how I \u2018wasted\u2019 the day if something derailed my plans, like a meeting running late. It\u2019s like the stress from work bled into everything else, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was failing to \u2018optimize\u2019 my time, even on weekends."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness in discussing how work stress and rigid expectations have affected your life. Let\u2019s explore a bit more about your support system\u2014could you share how your friends have helped you cope, even if it\u2019s challenging to open up about these thoughts? Also, have you faced any traumatic or difficult experiences in your life that might connect to how you handle unexpected changes or stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My friends are good about checking in on me, like buying me coffee or dragging me out for a walk when I\u2019ve been stuck in my head. But I don\u2019t really talk to them about the\u2026 you know, the \u2018wasted day\u2019 stuff. It feels too personal, like they\u2019d think I\u2019m overreacting. As for tough experiences\u2026 I guess growing up, I was always Type-A with schedules and projects. In high school, a canceled robotics competition made me feel like I\u2019d \u2018lost\u2019 weeks of prep time. It\u2019s just\u2026 built up since then. No single trauma, just this habit of seeing disruptions as failures. Frustrating, right?"}

{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how these thoughts impact your life, Jared. It\u2019s important we ensure your safety as we move forward. Have you ever had thoughts of intentionally harming yourself or ending your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts like that. My struggles are more about anxiety and feeling like I lose control when plans change, but I\u2019ve never wanted to harm myself. I\u2019ve focused on trying to manage the stress through routines or talking to friends, even if it\u2019s not working great right now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness, Jared. To better understand your current state, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels recently\u2014such as needing less sleep, feeling unusually energetic, or having difficulty slowing down?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, my sleep\u2019s been off. I\u2019ll stay up late ruminating about things that went wrong during the day, then I\u2019m too wired to wind down even if I want to. It\u2019s like my brain fixates on the 'wasted' time and I can\u2019t shake it. Lately, I\u2019ve been waking up around 3 a.m. trying to re-plan my day, which just makes me exhausted the next day. My energy\u2019s been all over the place\u2014drained most of the time, but with bursts of restless energy when I\u2019m stuck in these thought loops."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing so openly, Jared. It sounds like these sleep disruptions and energy fluctuations are taking a real toll. Let\u2019s explore another aspect\u2014have you ever felt unusually energetic or restless to the point where it was hard to slow down, or spent a lot of time doing many things at once without seeing a problem?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't experienced that. My energy issues are more about feeling drained or anxious when plans go off track. I get really tense when unexpected things happen, but I don't feel 'overly energetic' or like I can't slow down. My Type-A side drives me to stick to schedules, but that's more about control than restlessness."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity, Jared. To cover another important area\u2014have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in the past month, and if so, how often? This helps us understand any factors that might be influencing your energy or mood patterns."}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in the past month. I\u2019ve tried to avoid relying on anything like that because I want to address this mentally rather than mask it. Though... sometimes I wonder if stress might push me toward it eventually, but not recently."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your thoughtful approach to managing stress, Jared. To ensure we cover all relevant factors, are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal products?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I'm not on any medications or supplements right now. I haven't needed any prescriptions for this, and I don't take anything regularly\u2014just maybe a multivitamin occasionally, but that's it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty, Jared. To ensure we cover all important areas, have you ever experienced hallucinations (hearing, seeing, or sensing things others don\u2019t) or held beliefs that feel unusual or hard to let go of, even when others disagree?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hallucinations. As for beliefs, I guess my issue is more about rigid thinking around schedules\u2014like labeling days as 'wasted' if plans change. It\u2019s not that I hold odd beliefs, but this pattern feels deeply ingrained, even if it\u2019s irrational."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your detailed insights, Jared. To ensure we address all relevant factors, do you have any medical conditions such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a history of head injuries that might be relevant here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t have any of those medical conditions. I\u2019ve always been pretty healthy physically\u2014my sleep issues and fatigue are tied to the stress and anxiety from my thought patterns, not any underlying medical problem. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to work on the mental side of things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your thoroughness in describing your experiences, Jared. To conclude this phase, can you share what supports you have in your life that help you cope with stress or difficult times\u2014like friends, family, or activities that provide comfort or distraction?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve got a few close friends who check in with me, like grabbing coffee or going for walks when I seem off. But I usually keep the bigger stuff\u2014like the 'wasted day' thoughts\u2014to myself. I worry they\u2019d think I\u2019m being too dramatic. For stress, I\u2019ll sometimes get lost in video games or tinkering with old electronics at home. It\u2019s a way to zone out, but it\u2019s more escape than solving anything. My strict routine helps too\u2014sticking to a schedule feels stable, even if it\u2019s my own cage sometimes."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Jared, based on our discussion, I understand that your lifelong tendency to label unexpected disruptions as 'wasted' has intensified with recent work stressors, creating a cycle of rumination and exhaustion. This pattern began in adolescence, was reinforced by a high school competition cancellation, and now interacts with job demands that leave little room for flexibility. The formulation suggests perfectionism and fear of vulnerability as core themes, with work pressures and rigid self-expectations perpetuating the issue\u2014while your proactive approach to care and support system are key strengths. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the main points. One thing you might\u2019ve missed is that the high school competition was a robotics event\u2014I\u2019d spent weeks prepping, and when it was canceled, it felt like I\u2019d literally lost time. That stuck with me. Also, I haven\u2019t told friends how much this actually weighs on me because I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll think I\u2019m overreacting, so I keep it private. Oh, and I\u2019ve never been to therapy before, so this is all new territory. The stress isn\u2019t extreme, but it\u2019s nonstop, and it\u2019s starting to eat into weekends and make me feel alone even when I\u2019m around people."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Reports chronic anxiety around unexpected disruptions worsening since adolescence, intensified by work stress last year. Sleep disturbances (3 a.m. rumination, exhaustion), rigid scheduling, and 'wasted time' rumination. High school robotics competition cancellation (age ~18) solidified fear of time loss. No suicidal ideation or substance use in past month. Avoids discussing emotional struggles with friends due to fear of being perceived as 'overreacting.'\n\nObjective: Occupational impairment noted (team dynamics, weekend isolation). Sleep study recommended for insomnia severity. No acute safety concerns. No medications\/supplements in use. Cognitive rigidity around time optimization observed. Support system includes friends (superficial engagement) and solitary coping (video games, electronics).\n\nAssessment: Perfectionism and fear of vulnerability perpetuate anxiety cycle. Work stress amplifies rigid thought patterns. Sleep disturbance likely exacerbates emotional dysregulation. No psychotic features or medical comorbidities. Low baseline but persistent stress impacting work-life balance.\n\nPlan: Cognitive restructuring for 'wasted time' narratives. Sleep hygiene education. Gradual exposure to schedule flexibility. Explore safe disclosure strategies with friends. Monitor work stressors. Rule out insomnia disorder with sleep assessment.\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
