{"role":"interviewer","content":"Allison, before we begin, I just want to confirm\u2014would you like me to use a different name or pronouns? I want to make sure I respect your preferences."}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, Allison is correct and I use she\/her pronouns. Thank you for checking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for confirming, Allison. I appreciate your openness. Allison, can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with our session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I think so. It feels a bit awkward at first, but I\u2019m ready to talk through it. The frustration\u2019s been weighing on me, so this seems like the right step."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I'm glad you're ready to work through this. To set the frame, our sessions will involve discussing your concerns and exploring strategies to support you. Does that align with what you're hoping for today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that sounds good. I\u2019m hoping to figure out why this feels so frustrating and how to stop letting it ruin my enjoyment. It\u2019s supposed to be fun, but now it just stresses me out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much this frustration has impacted your enjoyment, Allison. Do you have any questions or concerns about how we\u2019ll proceed before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I\u2019m just not sure if talking about this will actually help me feel better. I\u2019ve spent so much time trying to figure it out on my own, but maybe... maybe this could be a way to finally figure out how to stop feeling so stuck about it?"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this frustration has been building over time. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings starting, and if there was a specific moment or change that seemed to trigger them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It all started when I first joined the league last fall. I remember the first week, I thought I had a solid team, but then I misread the scoring rules and lost points. That moment made me feel like I was fumbling from the start, and it\u2019s just been building ever since. I try to catch up, but every week there\u2019s another rule I missed or a strategy I didn\u2019t consider."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the ongoing frustration has been really draining. What would you most like to achieve through our work together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I want to stop letting this game consume me in such a negative way. It used to be fun, but now it just feels like a chore that I\u2019m bad at. I want to understand why I can\u2019t let go of it and how to enjoy the time I spend on it without it making me feel so... broken afterward."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that vulnerable reflection. It sounds like the emotional weight of these feelings is really impacting your self-perception. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, energy levels, or sleep patterns that seem connected to this frustration?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I've noticed my mood feels more irritable lately, especially after league results are posted. I also sometimes stay up late ruminating about my team's performance, which leaves me more tired the next day. My energy during the day feels... inconsistent, like I'm drained after spending hours on the game but still can't shake the frustration."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness in sharing how this has affected your enjoyment. To better understand patterns, have you experienced any significant stressors, challenges, or traumatic events in your life that might be connected to these feelings of frustration or self-doubt?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s really linked to this... This is actually the first time I\u2019ve felt this kind of frustration with something I enjoy. I\u2019ve always tried to stay positive, but this feels different. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t shake the sense that I\u2019m just not \u2018getting it,\u2019 even when I\u2019m putting in the work."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that this feels uniquely frustrating despite your usual positivity. Let's explore your support system\u2014can you tell me more about the friends you have in the fantasy football league? How do they typically interact with you during the season?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My friends in the league are mostly people I work with and a few from college. We mostly interact through the app\u2014trading players, sending jokes about draft picks, or trash-talking after weekly results. They\u2019re pretty laid-back, but I feel like they all know the rules instinctively, while I have to double-check everything. I\u2019ve avoided talking to them about *my* frustration because I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know, weak or whiny? It\u2019s embarrassing to admit I still don\u2019t fully get the nuances, even after all this time."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to ask about your substance use history. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances like stimulants or opioids in the past year? Have you noticed any changes in your use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don't use alcohol or drugs regularly. I haven't felt the need to use anything to cope with the stress from the league, but I'll admit I've had a few late nights where I maybe drank more coffee than I should have while analyzing rosters. Nothing else, though."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the coffee. Let's talk about your well-being. Have you ever had thoughts of intentionally harming yourself or ending your life, even if only briefly?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't had thoughts like that. My frustration has been intense, but it\u2019s never reached the point of wanting to harm myself. I\u2019ve just felt stuck in this cycle of stress and embarrassment, but I know it\u2019s not life-threatening\u2014just really draining."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. Let's talk about your energy levels. Have you noticed any changes in your energy or sleep patterns recently\u2014like feeling more energetic than usual or needing significantly less sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I've been staying up late ruminating over the league results, which leaves me exhausted and with inconsistent energy levels the next day. It's like my brain can't switch off, and even small mistakes feel huge when I'm so tired."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the stress from the league is really taking a toll on your rest and energy. Let\u2019s check in on other patterns\u2014have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic, restless, or needed very little sleep for days at a time, even when stressed? This helps me understand your overall energy regulation."}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. The stress has mostly left me exhausted, not energized. I do stay up late ruminating over matches, but it\u2019s more like my brain won\u2019t shut off than feeling hyper or restless. I\u2019ve never experienced that \u2018unusual energy\u2019 you\u2019re asking about\u2014it\u2019s all just been this draining cycle of frustration and sleeplessness for me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your fatigue and frustration have been persistent without the ups and downs of hypomania. Let\u2019s check in on another area\u2014have you noticed any unusual thoughts or perceptions lately, like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or feeling strongly that people are targeting you in some way?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced anything like hearing voices or seeing things. My thoughts have mostly been fixated on overanalyzing the game rules and second-guessing my decisions. Sometimes I feel like everyone else \u2018gets it\u2019 intuitively, and I\u2019m just... stuck trying to catch up. It\u2019s more self-criticism than anything surreal."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're managing stress without turning to substances, which is a strength. Have you been taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly\u2014prescribed or over-the-counter\u2014that might affect your mood or energy levels?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I\u2019m not taking any medications or supplements regularly. I tried a multivitamin once, but I don\u2019t think it made a difference."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the frustration around your fantasy football league has created a cycle of self-doubt and exhaustion, but you're also showing strength by seeking help and reflecting on what's working and not working. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think what might be missing is how this league feels like it\u2019s testing my worth\u2014like if I can\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 it, I\u2019m not just bad at the game but maybe unskilled in ways that matter. And while I say I want to enjoy it, part of me secretly thinks I *should* be great at it, which makes the losses feel personal. Also, I haven\u2019t mentioned how I sometimes avoid checking the league app for days because it\u2019s too anxiety-inducing, but then I hyperfocus later to \u2018catch up\u2019\u2014it\u2019s this push-pull that\u2019s exhausting."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this cycle of avoidance and hyperfocus, paired with tying your self-worth to performance in the league, has created a pattern that feels both emotionally and physically draining. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think you might\u2019ve missed how much I fear being judged as \u2018not trying hard enough\u2019 by others in the league. Even though I avoid talking to them, I constantly worry they notice my mistakes or see my late-night second-guessing as weakness. It feels like there\u2019s a silent standard everyone else meets, and I\u2019m the only one scrambling to catch up\u2014like I\u2019m secretly failing at being a \u2018real\u2019 participant. It\u2019s not just about losing the game; it\u2019s like I\u2019m proving I\u2019m not good enough, even in a space that was supposed to be fun."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014the fear of being judged as 'not trying hard enough' adds another layer to how this league is impacting your self-perception and social interactions. To wrap up, let\u2019s outline next steps. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing these patterns? For example, would you prefer to explore strategies for managing the anxiety around league interactions, or breaking the cycle of avoidance and hyperfocus? Feel free to add anything else I haven\u2019t covered."}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think breaking the cycle of hyperfocus would be a good first step\u2014before the league even starts, I\u2019m already overcommitting hours to perfecting teams, which leaves me drained and more prone to stress. If we could explore how to set clearer boundaries around my time and energy for this, it might ease the pressure. I also want to work on the fear of asking for help, since that\u2019s keeping me stuck in the \u2018I should already know this\u2019 mindset. Those two things feel like they\u2019d tackle both the exhaustion and the frustration roots."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve identified key patterns: perfectionism around league performance, fear of judgment driving avoidance and hyperfocus cycles, and rigid self-expectations that amplify frustration. To clarify, would you say this model captures your experience, or is there something important I\u2019ve overlooked? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think that captures a lot of it\u2014especially the comparison to others in the league. I feel like they\u2019re all \u2018naturals\u2019 while I\u2019m constantly second-guessing, which makes me hyperfocus even more. What I\u2019d add is how this obsession crowds out other hobbies I used to enjoy, like reading. I used to lose myself in books, but now I\u2019m too drained from analyzing spreadsheets to focus on anything else. It\u2019s like the game isn\u2019t even fun anymore\u2014it\u2019s just this\u2026 compulsion I can\u2019t break."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve captured how this compulsion is crowding out your reading and other hobbies, adding to the sense of being trapped in a cycle you can\u2019t control. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You didn\u2019t miss much, but maybe the part where I feel like I\u2019m overcompensating by reading every rulebook and forum post twice\u2014like if I just memorize everything, it\u2019ll fix the shame. Also, I haven\u2019t mentioned how I sometimes skip my morning walks to analyze rosters at 2 a.m., then feel guilty for letting my health slip. It\u2019s like the guilt and the guilt about the guilt are both fueling the cycle."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve captured how the guilt and overcompensation are fueling the cycle, along with the physical toll it\u2019s taking on your routine. To confirm, would you say this model reflects your experience, or is there anything still missing? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The model captures a lot, but I think the part about comparing myself to others is even deeper. My friends seem to 'get it' instantly, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling they\u2019re judging me for being slow to learn. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not just failing at the game\u2014I\u2019m failing at being *good* at it, which feels like a personal flaw."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve woven in the deeper layer of self-comparison and the personalization of failure. Before finalizing our next steps, is there anything else you\u2019d want to add to this model to ensure it fully reflects your experience? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"What\u2019s maybe missing is how much this feels like a personal failure\u2014not just not getting the rules, but that I can\u2019t *adapt* like others do. It\u2019s like everyone else sees the game as fun and fluid, but I feel like I\u2019m decoding a foreign language every week. I keep thinking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I just *get* it?\u2019 Even when I research, it\u2019s like the rules shift, and I\u2019m always playing catch-up. I guess\u2026 it\u2019s making me question if I\u2019m just not \u2018sharp\u2019 enough in areas that matter to people I respect. I haven\u2019t said it out loud yet, but part of me fears this is a sign I\u2019m\u2026 not capable in ways that matter beyond fantasy football."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve captured how the personalization of failure and rigid self-expectations are central to this cycle, along with the toll it\u2019s taking on your energy and hobbies. To finalize next steps, let\u2019s clarify: Would you be comfortable starting with strategies to set boundaries around league time and practice self-compassion when learning feels challenging, while also exploring how to reframe comparisons to others? Is there anything else you\u2019d add to this plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that sounds like a good starting point. I think setting clearer time limits would help\u2014I often lose track of hours spent tweaking lineups. I also struggle with nighttime rumination about 'what if' scenarios, so maybe techniques to quiet that would help. And maybe some guidance on how to broach this with my friends without feeling ashamed? I want to stop letting this drain my energy and joy."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for adding those important details about time boundaries, nighttime rumination, and communication with friends\u2014they\u2019ll guide our focus moving forward. To confirm, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what\u2019s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think the core issues are covered, but maybe the fear of judgment from friends if I admit how overwhelmed I feel? I worry they\u2019ll think I\u2019m overreacting, which makes me isolate more. That\u2019s part of why I keep ruminating alone instead of asking for help."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about the fear of judgment\u2014it\u2019s clear this fear of being seen as 'overreacting' is deeply tied to your isolation and rumination. To finalize, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what\u2019s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"..."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that fear of judgment\u2014it\u2019s clear how much this is fueling your isolation and rumination. To finalize, would you say this model and next steps fully capture what\u2019s most urgent for you, or is there one more piece we should address before finalizing? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think what\u2019s missing is how this is starting to bleed into my confidence in other areas. I catch myself doubting my decisions in other parts of life, like when I make small mistakes at work, and now I\u2019m hyper-focused on proving I\u2019m competent somewhere. It\u2019s not just the league anymore\u2014it\u2019s making me feel unmoored."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the self-doubt from the league is now spilling into your work confidence, creating a sense of being unmoored in daily life. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Actually, my work hasn't been affected\u2014this is strictly about the league and my hobbies. I think I mentioned how it\u2019s making me question my ability to *enjoy* things, not my job performance. I guess you might\u2019ve wondered if there\u2019s a bigger pattern, but this really started and stays within the fantasy football world."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Allison reports frustration and self-doubt related to fantasy football league participation since fall 2023. Symptoms include irritability, sleep disturbances (late-night rumination), emotional exhaustion, and avoidance of league interactions. She describes a cycle of hyperfocus on rules\/strategies followed by avoidance due to anxiety. Emotional impact includes self-criticism ('I\u2019m not sharp enough') and fear of judgment ('they\u2019ll think I\u2019m weak').\n\nObjective: No significant medical history. No suicidal ideation or substance use beyond caffeine. Social functioning impacted by avoidance of league peers and neglect of hobbies (e.g., reading). Work performance unaffected. Observed cognitive patterns: perfectionism, fear of failure, and rumination.\n\nAssessment: Chronic stress from performance-based self-criticism in low-stakes social context. Anxiety-driven avoidance\/hyperfocus cycle. Fear of social judgment exacerbates isolation. No hypomanic symptoms. No psychotic features. Emerging self-worth tied to external validation in recreational activity.\n\nPlan: 1) Establish time-bound league engagement strategies. 2) Cognitive restructuring for self-criticism and social comparison. 3) Sleep hygiene and rumination-breaking techniques. 4) Gradual exposure to peer communication about struggles. 5) Monitor for generalization of self-doubt to other domains.\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
