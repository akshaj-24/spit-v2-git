{"role":"interviewer","content":"Matthew, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Matthew. My pronouns are he\/him. I\u2019ve always used Matthew, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Matthew, our time together will involve discussing your concerns and exploring ways to support you. We'll start by talking about what's been on your mind and then work on strategies to help. Does that sound okay to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that sounds okay. I guess... I just need to get this out. The test is like... it\u2019s all I can think about, and I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll mess everything up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the test is really weighing on you right now. Is there anything you'd like to ask me before we dive deeper into this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think I\u2019ve shared the main things I\u2019m struggling with. Maybe we can talk about how to manage the anxiety without isolating myself? I worry I\u2019m pushing people away."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty, Matthew. May I proceed with exploring ways to support you while ensuring you feel comfortable throughout our conversation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, please proceed. I just... I really need to figure this out before the test. It\u2019s hard explaining how much this weighs on me sometimes. The what-ifs keep looping in my head."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to perform on your final test is really weighing on you, and I appreciate you sharing how it\u2019s affecting your relationships and daily life. Can you tell me more about what you\u2019re hoping to achieve by coming in for counseling? What would help you feel more supported right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I\u2019m hoping to learn how to manage the anxiety without letting it take over. I\u2019ve tried studying nonstop, but it\u2019s not helping, and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m making things worse by pushing people away. If I could get tools to focus without the panic and maybe... talk through the fear of failure, that would help. Just feeling like there\u2019s a way to handle this without everything falling apart."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing those hopes\u2014it\u2019s important to have clear goals. Can you help me understand when these feelings of pressure and anxiety first started for you and how they\u2019ve changed over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started maybe two months ago, around when the final test schedule was announced. At first, it was just... tightness in my chest when I thought about it. But now, it\u2019s nonstop. The more I study, the more I feel like I\u2019m not retaining anything. I\u2019ll lie awake at night replaying problems I got wrong, and if I see a friend, I\u2019ll cut the conversation short because I\u2019m panicking about what if I\u2019m not ready. It\u2019s like the pressure is this weight that got heavier each week."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure has grown steadily, affecting both your studies and connections with others. Can you share what strategies you\u2019ve tried to cope with this anxiety, and whether any have felt helpful or made things better?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve tried studying nonstop and asking teachers for reassurance, but it doesn\u2019t really help. I also avoid talking to friends about it, thinking it\u2019ll keep me focused, but I just feel more alone. My sleep\u2019s been worse too, even when I try to wind down."}

{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing that. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life, even if you haven't made a plan or intended to act on them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts about ending my life. My anxiety feels overwhelming at times, but I\u2019m focused on getting through this test and figuring out how to manage the pressure. It\u2019s scary, but I haven\u2019t felt that desperate yet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. Have you used any substances, such as alcohol, cannabis, or others, recently or in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used any substances like alcohol or cannabis before. I\u2019ve been trying to stay focused through study alone, even if it means losing sleep\u2014caffeine is the only thing I\u2019ve relied on, but I know it\u2019s not helping long-term."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about avoiding substances to stay focused. Let\u2019s briefly check for other symptoms that might be impacting you: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns recently\u2014like feeling unusually energetic or needing much less sleep than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, my sleep has been really disrupted. I\u2019ve been lying awake for hours, my mind racing about the test, and when I do sleep, it\u2019s fitful. I wake up exhausted, which makes studying even harder."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the sleep difficulties. Let's briefly check for other symptoms: Have you been feeling unusually energetic or restless lately, or have you noticed yourself taking risks you wouldn't normally take, even if it's related to your test preparation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t felt unusually energetic or taken risks I wouldn\u2019t normally consider. My anxiety has made me more cautious, almost paralyzed, in some ways\u2014like avoiding social interactions to 'protect' my focus. The restlessness I feel is more from my mind racing with what-ifs, not from impulsivity."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your anxiety has been deeply affecting your daily life, especially your sleep and social interactions. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking or perception, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or having thoughts that feel strange or unfamiliar?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t heard voices or seen things that others don\u2019t. But sometimes my mind feels like it\u2019s stuck on repeat\u2014like, I can\u2019t stop thinking about worst-case scenarios, even when I try to focus on something else. It\u2019s more like my thoughts are always spinning, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind\u2019s constant loop of worries is really exhausting. Let\u2019s check on medications: Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements\u2014like vitamins, herbal remedies, or stimulants? If so, could you share what they are and how you\u2019re using them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I\u2019m not taking any medications or supplements right now. I\u2019ve tried to handle everything on my own\u2014staying up late studying, asking teachers for help\u2014but it\u2019s hard to focus on anything else besides the test. I guess I\u2019ve avoided pills because I don\u2019t want to rely on them, but it\u2019s getting harder to keep going like this."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the mental strain you're under. To ensure we have a full picture, have you experienced any other physical health concerns recently\u2014like chronic pain, thyroid issues, or sleep apnea\u2014that might be affecting your well-being?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with anything like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. The biggest physical thing is my sleep\u2014like, I\u2019ll lie awake for hours worrying about the test, or wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. Sometimes my chest feels tight when I\u2019m panicking, but that\u2019s probably just anxiety. I haven\u2019t had any other ongoing health problems."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you have a supportive family and friends, even though you've been isolating yourself. Can you tell me a bit more about how you've been connecting with them, or what supports you feel you have in place to help manage this stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I mean, they\u2019ve always been there, but honestly... I haven\u2019t really let them in. I\u2019ll text my mom quick updates like \u2018studying\u2019 or \u2018okay,\u2019 but if they ask how I\u2019m really doing, I just say I\u2019m fine. My friends have tried checking in, but I\u2019ve been brushing them off\u2014like, canceling plans or saying I\u2019m too busy. Part of me feels guilty, but I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll think I\u2019m overreacting or that I\u2019m being weak. My dad used to say \u2018just breathe\u2019 when I got nervous about tests before, but now it\u2019s not funny, and I don\u2019t want to make them worry."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure around your final test has created a cycle of anxiety that's affecting your sleep, focus, and relationships. What did I miss about your experience or how this has unfolded?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess what I haven\u2019t mentioned much is how my hands sometimes shake when I try to study, and I get this nausea when I think about the test. Also, I feel guilty for pushing people away because I know they\u2019re worried about me, but I don\u2019t want them to see how messed up I feel inside."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear the physical symptoms like shaking and nausea adding to your distress, and your guilt about isolating loved ones. Let me offer a brief model: It sounds like the pressure to perform (precipitating factor) is interacting with underlying anxiety tendencies (predisposing), creating physical symptoms and avoidance behaviors (perpetuating), while your support system and proactive help-seeking remain key strengths. Does this align with your experience, or is there something I\u2019ve missed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that fits. The pressure\u2019s definitely the trigger, and I\u2019ve always had a tendency to overthink things. The shaking and nausea started when I realized how bad I was letting it consume me. I guess I\u2019m isolating because I\u2019m scared my family or friends will think I\u2019m being dramatic or that I\u2019m not handling it \u2018right\u2019\u2014like it\u2019s somehow my fault I can\u2019t just calm down. The more I try to push through it alone, the worse it gets, but I keep thinking if I just study harder or ignore the anxiety, maybe it\u2019ll go away. It hasn\u2019t, though. The cycle\u2019s exhausting."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014I appreciate your honesty about how isolating this has become, even while it feels counterproductive. Let\u2019s build on our understanding: Given the cycle we\u2019ve outlined, what would be most helpful for us to focus on first as we work toward breaking this cycle and supporting your test preparation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think figuring out how to stop isolating myself would help first. I\u2019m terrified they\u2019ll think I\u2019m weak for feeling this way, but I miss their support. Maybe learning how to ask for help without feeling like a burden?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about wanting to build communication strategies that feel safe and reduce guilt. Let\u2019s shape that into action: Would role-playing conversations with family\/friends or setting small, specific goals for reaching out (e.g., sharing one worry with a trusted person) feel manageable as a starting point? Is there anything else we should prioritize to support this work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Role-playing conversations sounds... manageable, I guess. Just thinking about talking to someone about this makes my chest feel tight, but I want to try. Maybe starting with a small goal, like telling my mom one thing I\u2019m worried about, could help. But what if they think I\u2019m overreacting? I keep worrying it\u2019ll make things worse. I need to know how to frame it without feeling like I\u2019m a burden. The guilt of pulling people in when I should be studying\u2014it\u2019s overwhelming."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the mix of hope and fear around reaching out\u2014it\u2019s brave to want connection while feeling so vulnerable. Let me check if we\u2019re aligned: The key points are your anxiety cycle (pressure \u2192 physical symptoms \u2192 isolation \u2192 guilt), your desire to build safe communication strategies, and the specific role-playing\/small goals approach we discussed. What did I miss or need to adjust before we shape next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that pretty much nails it. The guilt part feels especially heavy\u2014I isolate because I\u2019m scared people will think I\u2019m overreacting, but then I feel awful for pushing them away. Also, the chest tightness and sleepless nights make it hard to even try studying effectively. Maybe we should also address how the fear of failure feels... bigger than just the test? Like, I keep thinking it\u2019ll define my whole future somehow."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about the weight of guilt and how the fear of failure feels tied to your identity beyond the test itself. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or adjust about your experience that might help shape our plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it\u2019s also important to mention how my fear of failing feels tied to proving myself\u2014not just to others, but to myself. Like, if I don\u2019t ace this test, I\u2019m not just letting people down\u2026 I\u2019m letting down the version of me I *want* to be. And the panic attacks? They\u2019re worse when I\u2019m alone, which is ironic because I push people away to avoid burdening them. It\u2019s this cycle I can\u2019t break."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Matthew (he\/him) reports severe anxiety related to an upcoming high-stakes test, with symptoms including chest tightness, nausea, shaking hands, and sleep disturbances (insomnia, fitful sleep) for ~2 months. Anxiety intensified after test schedule announcement, worsening weekly. Avoids social interactions to 'protect focus,' leading to isolation and guilt. Fear of failure tied to self-identity: 'If I don\u2019t ace this test, I\u2019m letting down the version of me I want to be.'\n\nObjective: Impaired academic performance (ineffective studying), strained relationships (self-reported withdrawal from family\/friends). No suicidal ideation or substance use. No psychotic symptoms. Physical symptoms: autonomic arousal (tachycardia, nausea), fatigue from disrupted sleep. Notable avoidance behaviors (cancelling plans, minimal communication).\n\nAssessment: Anxiety disorder (exam-related, with somatic and cognitive symptoms). Perpetuating factors: isolation, catastrophic thinking ('what-ifs'), guilt-driven avoidance. Predisposing factors: self-identity linked to academic performance, fear of perceived weakness. No acute safety risks. Strengths: proactive help-seeking, intact insight.\n\nPlan: 1) Role-play communication strategies to reduce isolation (e.g., sharing one concern with family). 2) Address guilt and fear of burdening others through cognitive restructuring. 3) Develop test-specific anxiety management (grounding techniques, sleep hygiene). 4) Monitor physical symptoms and self-compassion practices. Follow-up to assess progress in breaking isolation cycle.\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
