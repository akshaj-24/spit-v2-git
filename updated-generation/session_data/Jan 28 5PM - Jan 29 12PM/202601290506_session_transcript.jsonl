{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Erik, could you share your preferred name and pronouns with me?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name is Erik, and I use he\/him pronouns."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing, Erik. Can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with today's session as we begin to discuss what's been bringing you here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I want to get through this... but I'm kinda nervous talking about all of it. My hands are shaking a little, honestly."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's okay to feel nervous; we'll take things at your pace. Can you let me know if you have any questions about how today's session will go before we start?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think I have any questions right now. I\u2019m just\u2026 a little nervous, but I want to get through this. I guess I\u2019m hoping we can figure out why I can\u2019t stop worrying about whether my boyfriend really loves me. It\u2019s been taking up so much space in my head, even at work, where I\u2019m supposed to be focusing on code."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's completely normal to feel uneasy about these conversations, Erik. Can you confirm that you understand today's session will focus on exploring your concerns about your relationship and how they're impacting your daily life, with the goal of understanding them better together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I get that. I guess I\u2019m here because I can\u2019t stop worrying he doesn\u2019t really love me, even when we\u2019ve been together five years. It\u2019s messing with my job and just\u2026 everything else."}

{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this fear has been really affecting your work and relationship. Can you share more about what might have contributed to these feelings starting around six months ago?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it started when he got this big project at work six months ago. He\u2019s been working late, coming home exhausted, and we just don\u2019t talk as much as before. At first I told myself it was just the project, but\u2026 when he\u2019d zones out during our evenings together or cancels plans last-minute, I start thinking maybe he doesn\u2019t love me anymore. I\u2019ve tried bringing it up, but he says he *does* love me, and that just\u2026 makes me doubt myself more. I guess I crave hearing it more often, but it feels like I\u2019m nagging now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like trying to communicate your needs has left you feeling both vulnerable and unheard. What are your hopes for how counseling might help with these challenges?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I want to understand why this fear won\u2019t go away, even after years together. I\u2019ve tried talking, but it feels like I\u2019m hitting a wall\u2026 so maybe counseling can help me figure out if it\u2019s something *I\u2019m* doing, or if there\u2019s a way to bridge this gap. I don\u2019t want to keep doubting every text he sends or every time he\u2019s busy at work\u2014it\u2019s exhausting."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this uncertainty is taking a real toll, and it\u2019s brave to want to explore it. What have you found helpful or unhelpful in managing these worries so far?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Talking to my boyfriend has been unhelpful because it just makes me feel worse when he can\u2019t reassure me the way I need. My best friend listens, but they don\u2019t understand how to fix the fear\u2014it just swirls in my head until I can\u2019t focus on coding anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your best friend\u2019s support helps with listening, but not with calming the fear itself. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or moments when the anxiety feels especially intense beyond when your boyfriend is working?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No changes in my sleep yet, but the anxiety feels worse in the evenings when we\u2019re physically together but not really talking. Like, if he\u2019s scrolling on his phone or just quiet, my mind starts spiraling. It\u2019s like I need constant proof he\u2019s paying attention, but even then, I still doubt it. My hands actually get shaky sometimes during those moments."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure I understand all factors that might be influencing this. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant challenges in your life that could be connected to these feelings of insecurity in your relationship?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No traumatic events come to mind, but I\u2019ve always struggled with needing constant reassurance to feel secure. Before my boyfriend, I dated someone who was emotionally distant, and I think that left me more reliant on verbal affirmations. But with my current partner, it\u2019s different\u2014he\u2019s not distant, just\u2026 really focused on his work lately. The problem is, I can\u2019t shake the fear that his busyness means he\u2019s pulling away, even when he says he isn\u2019t."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your need for verbal reassurance has been a long-standing part of your relationships. Can you share a bit about your family dynamics growing up? Were emotional expressions of love or reassurance something that was common in your household?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My family wasn\u2019t really expressive with emotions. My parents worked a lot, so most of the love I felt was through things they did\u2014like making sure I had everything I needed\u2014but they weren\u2019t the type to say \u2018I love you\u2019 much. I guess I always felt like I had to prove I was \u2018okay\u2019 to get their attention. Now, with my boyfriend, I crave those three little words, but it\u2019s scary to ask for them because I don\u2019t want to seem\u2026 weak. But part of me thinks if I don\u2019t hear them, I\u2019ll never be sure."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to ask about your substance use to better understand your current health. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past month, including for stress relief or to help with sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used any substances in the past month. I\u2019ve been trying to focus on work and my relationship, but I get really anxious sometimes\u2014like last week when I couldn\u2019t sleep after another quiet evening with my boyfriend. I just... I don\u2019t want to risk my job or health by doing anything reckless. My hands are still shaking a little, though."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to check in on your safety. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently? If so, could you share how often these thoughts occur, whether you have a plan, and what supports help you stay safe?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life. My main struggle is the anxiety and fear around my relationship, which feels overwhelming at times, but I haven\u2019t reached that point. I\u2019m here for help because I want to work through these feelings and improve my mental state."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns, such as needing less sleep or feeling unusually restless?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I\u2019ve been having a hard time sleeping. I\u2019ll lie awake for hours at night, my mind just going over the same worries about my boyfriend. Even when I do fall asleep, I feel like I wake up just as tired. My body feels restless, like I\u2019m constantly wound up, and I don\u2019t have as much energy during the day. It\u2019s making it even harder to focus at work."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how exhausting this restlessness and worry must be for you. Have you experienced any periods of feeling unusually energetic or having a lot of ideas recently, even without much sleep? This helps me check for patterns of mood shifts."}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had those kinds of energy spikes. When I\u2019m stressed, I actually have trouble sleeping\u2014my mind races with what-ifs about my relationship. Sometimes I\u2019ll lie awake for hours, replaying conversations or wondering if I\u2019m \u2018reading too much\u2019 into things. It\u2019s more like restless overthinking than feeling energized."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to check if there are any medications, supplements, or vitamins you're currently taking that might affect your mood or anxiety? This includes over-the-counter items or things you take for sleep\/stress."}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t take any medications, supplements, or vitamins right now. I\u2019ve never needed anything like that before, and I haven\u2019t tried anything for the anxiety or sleep issues\u2014it just hasn\u2019t felt like the right step yet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to check for any other experiences that might affect your thinking. Have you noticed any times when you hear voices, see things others don\u2019t, or have thoughts that feel unusual or paranoid? This helps me understand if there are any patterns in how your mind processes stress."}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hearing voices or seeing things that others don\u2019t. My thoughts are mostly about my relationship\u2014like fearing my boyfriend\u2019s love isn\u2019t real\u2014but they don\u2019t feel \u2018paranoid\u2019 in a strange way. It\u2019s more... constant worry, not hallucinations. I just feel insecure, not like my mind is breaking."}
