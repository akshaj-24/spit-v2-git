{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for coming in today, Megan. To start, would you prefer I use a specific pronoun when referring to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, please use 'she' and 'her' \u2013 I haven't really thought about it much before, but that works for me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for clarifying, Megan. Can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with this session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I\u2019m okay with continuing. I really need to figure out why I can\u2019t shake this feeling of being useless at work anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that, Megan. Before we begin, do you have any questions about how this session will work or what we'll be discussing today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Not right now... but I guess I\u2019m a bit nervous. Will we focus on how to handle the stress at work, or more on the self-doubt? I just want to feel like I can do my job without panicking over little things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense to want clarity on our focus areas. Does that align with what you're hoping to work on today \u2013 managing stress and building confidence in your role?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that sounds right. I need help managing the stress and feeling more confident in my job. The fear of making mistakes is really getting to me, and it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling I\u2019ll mess up again."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these feelings started after the incident with the patient's vitals. Can you tell me how long ago that happened and if there was anything else going on at the time that might have contributed to these feelings?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was about three weeks ago. The shift was really busy\u2014two of my coworkers called in sick, so I had to cover extra patients. I was rushing between rooms and completely missed logging his vitals. By the time I realized, the nurse had already noted the delay. I felt awful, and it\u2019s been stuck in my head ever since."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how that mistake and the busy environment would be really distressing. Can you tell me more about what happens during these panic episodes you mentioned\u2014how often do they occur, and what do they feel like physically or emotionally?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"They happen maybe three or four times a week, mostly during shifts when I\u2019m overwhelmed. My heart races, my hands get shaky, and I feel like I can\u2019t catch my breath. Emotionally, it\u2019s like a wave of dread\u2014like I\u2019m about to mess up again and everyone will think I\u2019m useless. It usually passes after a few minutes, but it leaves me exhausted. I guess it\u2019s worst when I\u2019m alone in a patient room or handling something critical, like medications."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like these episodes are taking a toll on your energy and confidence. Have you found any strategies that help manage these feelings, even temporarily, or anything that makes them worse?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Not really\u2014most days I just try to work harder to prove I\u2019m not useless, but it backfires and I end up more exhausted. Honestly, the biggest trigger is when coworkers give me side-eye or correct me in front of others. That makes me feel like they think I\u2019m a joke as an orderly."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure at work has been really overwhelming, and it's understandable to feel shaken after an incident like that. Let's explore a bit more about your background. Have you experienced any traumatic or difficult events in your life that might relate to how you're feeling at work now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any major traumas, but\u2026 growing up, my mom was really strict about doing things perfectly. If I messed up even small tasks, she\u2019d get frustrated and say I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. I guess it made me super afraid of failing, even now. It\u2019s like\u2026 that voice in my head says, \u2018You\u2019ll never be good enough,\u2019 and it\u2019s getting louder lately at work."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014understanding how past experiences shape our fears is really important. Have you experienced other times in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or doubted your abilities in your job?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, this is the first time I\u2019ve felt like I *truly* can\u2019t handle my job. I\u2019ve had busy shifts before\u2014like when three patients spiked fevers at once\u2014but I always told myself I could manage. This feels different. Even small mistakes now\u2026 it\u2019s like a voice in my head keeps saying, \u2018See? You\u2019re not cut out for this.\u2019 I guess I hadn\u2019t realized how much that one incident would stick with me."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's important we address your safety first. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts of harming myself, but the stress has made it hard to sleep sometimes\u2014my mind just races at night with worries about work. I\u2019m trying to focus on staying positive, though."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the stress and sleep challenges. To better understand your current state, have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels, sleep patterns, or tendency to take risks that feel different from your usual experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, my sleep\u2019s been all over the place\u2014like, I\u2019ll lie awake for hours replaying mistakes in my head, then crash hard if I finally do sleep. The panic episodes leave me wiped, like I\u2019ve run a marathon even though I just sat there shaking. And... I\u2019ve started avoiding taking on extra tasks at work, even small ones, because I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll mess up again. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s on high alert all the time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how this has been affecting your work and confidence. To ensure we cover all areas, have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or intense paranoia recently that feel different from your usual experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced anything like that. The panic attacks are bad enough\u2014I get this intense fear I\u2019ll mess up again, but it\u2019s all tied to my anxiety about work. The voice in my head telling me I\u2019m \u2018not good enough\u2019 feels real, but it\u2019s just\u2026 my old fears, not something new or strange."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for clarifying that. It seems the anxiety is deeply tied to your work performance. Have you noticed any periods lately where you feel unusually energetic, need less sleep, or take more risks than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t noticed anything like that. I\u2019ve actually been feeling the opposite\u2014exhausted a lot, especially after those panic episodes. I worry so much about messing up that I\u2019m constantly mentally drained, not energized."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how exhaustion and self-criticism are affecting your energy. To continue, have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently, including frequency or amounts?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t changed my use of alcohol or cannabis recently. I\u2019ve tried to stay focused on work and haven\u2019t felt the need to use anything to cope, but I\u2019m definitely exhausted most nights."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about avoiding substances to cope. To ensure we have a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly, including over-the-counter ones?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I\u2019m not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly. I\u2019ve tried over-the-counter sleep aids\u5076\u5c14, like melatonin, but only a few times when I was really struggling to rest. They didn\u2019t help much, and I didn\u2019t want to get dependent on anything."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your detailed responses so far. To ensure we address all potential factors, have you noticed any other physical symptoms or health concerns that might be related to your stress or sleep issues, such as changes in appetite, headaches, or difficulty concentrating?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I haven\u2019t noticed headaches or appetite changes, but I\u2019ve been more exhausted than usual and sometimes struggle to focus during shifts, especially when I\u2019m stressed. It\u2019s hard to shake the panic, so my mind feels foggy afterward."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your detailed sharing about the exhaustion and focus challenges. To ensure we capture all protective factors, are there any friends, family, or activities that help you cope with stress or support your well-being?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I have a few close friends I usually lean on, but honestly, I haven\u2019t told them about these feelings yet. I\u2019ve kept it pretty private, even from them. Sometimes going out for coffee or walks helps me unwind, but lately, those little things don\u2019t really take my mind off the stress. My mom\u2019s been asking how work is, but I just say \u2018okay\u2019 and change the subject. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit how bad it\u2019s been."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing. To ensure we have a complete understanding, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to your symptoms?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with any medical conditions like that. I don\u2019t have any chronic physical health issues\u2014this is all about the stress and anxiety I\u2019ve been dealing with since the incident at work."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure I\u2019ve captured this accurately: It sounds like your current struggles with work-related anxiety and self-doubt stem from a mix of childhood perfectionism (predisposing), the recent vitals incident (precipitating), and ongoing stress about mistakes (perpetuating). Your proactive approach to seeking help is a strong protective factor. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That\u2019s mostly right, but I\u2019d add the sleep part\u2014I\u2019m crashing after panic episodes, and it\u2019s making me even more exhausted. Also, the melatonin I\u2019ve been trying hasn\u2019t helped much. And maybe the strained relationships with coworkers? Their side-eyes or corrections feel like they\u2019re reinforcing that \u2018useless\u2019 voice. But yeah, the core of it is those three factors you mentioned. It\u2019s just... heavier than I thought."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about the added layers of sleep disruption and workplace dynamics\u2014those are important pieces. To ensure we\u2019re aligned: Your main concerns include work-related anxiety, panic episodes with sleep disturbance, strained coworker relationships, and a critical inner voice tied to a recent incident. We\u2019ve identified predisposing factors (perfectionism), precipitating events (vitals incident), perpetuating stressors (workplace interactions, hypervigilance), and a protective factor (seeking help). What did I miss or need to adjust here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That\u2019s mostly accurate. I\u2019d add the panic attacks happen 3-4 times weekly, especially when overwhelmed or in patient rooms alone. Also, trying to work harder to \u2018prove\u2019 myself just makes me more stressed\u2014I feel like I\u2019m trapped in a cycle of fear and overcompensating. And yeah, my mom\u2019s criticism years ago definitely made this recent incident feel like a \u2018prophetic\u2019 failure. The coworker side-eyes and corrections feel like triggers for that old shame. Otherwise, that covers it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how the cycle of fear and overcompensating feels exhausting. Is there anything else we haven\u2019t discussed that\u2019s important to you or your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I haven\u2019t really talked about how I feel like I\u2019m failing at *everything* now. Even when I\u2019m not at work\u2014like trying to grocery shop or talk to my sister\u2014I catch myself second-guessing every choice, like, \u2018Did I pick the right cereal? Did I say something stupid?\u2019 It\u2019s like that one mistake opened a floodgate, and now I can\u2019t trust myself in any part of my life. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s scary how far it\u2019s spread."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how this self-doubt has spilled into your personal life, adding to the weight of what you\u2019re carrying. Let me briefly recap: We\u2019ve identified perfectionism as a long-standing pattern, the vitals incident as a recent trigger, and ongoing workplace stress and self-criticism as factors keeping this cycle going. Your proactive approach to addressing this is a strength. What did I miss or need to adjust here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re right about the cycle, but maybe you\u2019re underestimating how much my workaholic tendencies are part of the problem. I mentioned pushing myself to work harder after the mistake to \u2018prove\u2019 I\u2019m competent, but that actually makes the panic worse because I can\u2019t keep up. Also, the specific part about coworkers\u2019 side-eyes or public corrections\u2014those micro-moments of shame feel like they hit me harder now than they used to. It\u2019s not just stress; it\u2019s humiliation that fuels the fear."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how your workaholism and workplace dynamics amplify the cycle of fear and exhaustion. Let me finalize this summary: Your struggles stem from perfectionism (predisposing), the vitals incident (precipitating), and ongoing workplace stress\/shame (perpetuating). Your proactive approach to care is a key strength. What did I miss or need to adjust here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That\u2019s pretty accurate. I\u2019d add the constant fear of being labeled \u2018useless\u2019 by others\u2014like coworkers\u2019 side-eyes\u2014feels like it\u2019s written on my forehead. And the shame keeps me from talking to friends, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t isolate. Maybe the melatonin use is a small gap? It didn\u2019t help much, but I worried about becoming dependent. Otherwise, your summary hits the main points."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about how these fears and isolation deepen the cycle. Let\u2019s shape next steps: Would you prefer to focus on building confidence at work first, addressing the panic attacks, or exploring strategies to share your experiences with trusted friends? What feels most urgent to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The panic attacks feel most urgent right now\u2014they\u2019re leaving me drained and make it hard to focus at work. When my heart races and I can\u2019t catch my breath, it\u2019s like that \u2018useless\u2019 voice gets louder, and I freeze. I want to stop feeling like I\u2019m crumbling under pressure before I can even tackle rebuilding confidence."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for clarifying the urgency around panic attacks. Let me finalize our plan: We\u2019ll prioritize strategies to manage panic episodes\u2014such as grounding techniques, breathing exercises, and gradually confronting triggers\u2014while also exploring how to rebuild confidence at work. Does this align with what you need, and is there anything else I should include before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that sounds like what I need. The panic attacks are so draining, especially when they hit at work\u2014it\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped in my own head. I guess I\u2019d also like to work on\u2026 not feeling so ashamed when coworkers notice me struggling. It\u2019s hard to ask for help when I\u2019m already scared they\u2019ll think I\u2019m weak."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the shame and fear of being judged\u2014it\u2019s clear how these feelings compound the stress you\u2019re carrying. To finalize our plan: We\u2019ll prioritize panic management strategies and explore ways to address workplace shame while building confidence. Is there anything else we need to adjust or add before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think focusing on panic management makes sense, but could we also address how to handle the constant fear of being judged by coworkers? I get so flustered when I think they notice my mistakes, even if they don\u2019t. Also, the sleeplessness is really wearing me down \u2013 I\u2019d love tools to unwind without counting sheep or relying on melatonin. And maybe explore why this incident feels so much bigger than it probably was? Like, how to reframe those 'useless' thoughts when they come."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Megan reports work-related anxiety and panic attacks (3-4x\/week) since a vitals documentation error 3 weeks ago. Symptoms include tachycardia, tremors, dyspnea, and intrusive 'useless' self-criticism. Sleep disrupted by rumination; crash-sleeps post-episodes. Avoids extra work tasks due to fear of mistakes. Perfectionism rooted in childhood maternal criticism ('You\u2019ll never be good enough'). Shame about coworker interactions ('side-eyes') exacerbates symptoms. No suicidal ideation, but reports exhaustion and cognitive fog impacting work performance.\n\nObjective: Panic episodes triggered by work stressors (e.g., patient rooms, public corrections). Sleep disturbance noted (delayed sleep onset, fragmented rest). Occupational functioning impaired (avoidance, hypervigilance). No medical diagnoses or substance use changes. Melatonin used sporadically without efficacy.\n\nAssessment: Anxiety disorder secondary to precipitating incident (vitals error) + predisposing perfectionism. Perpetuating factors: workplace shame, self-criticism cycle, sleep disruption. Protective factor: proactive help-seeking. Panic attacks linked to performance anxiety; cognitive distortions ('prophetic failure') generalize to non-work domains.\n\nPlan: Prioritize panic management (grounding, breathing exercises). Address workplace shame through cognitive reframing. Develop sleep hygiene strategies. Gradual exposure to work tasks. Explore childhood perfectionism's role in self-evaluation. Monitor melatonin use. Collaborate on workplace communication strategies for perceived judgment.\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
