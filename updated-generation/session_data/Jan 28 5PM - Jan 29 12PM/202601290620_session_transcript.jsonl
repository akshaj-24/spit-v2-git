{"role":"interviewer","content":"Good morning, Ms. Hayes. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you please confirm your name and let me know if you have any pronouns you'd prefer me to use?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name is Cynthia Hayes. I go by she\/her pronouns, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. Today\u2019s session will focus on understanding your concerns and how we can work together to address them. The appointment is approximately 50 minutes. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I\u2019d like to proceed. I\u2019m just nervous about opening up, but I\u2019m ready to work on this."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It's completely understandable to feel nervous when starting something new; take comfort in knowing we'll go at your pace. Before we begin, do you have any immediate questions or concerns you'd like to address?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t have any questions right now, but I\u2019d like to mention that the guilt about missing my son\u2019s games is really weighing on me. I worry I\u2019m failing him, and it\u2019s hard to talk about without feeling embarrassed."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing that\u2014the pressure to balance work and parenting must feel incredibly heavy. What would you most like to achieve through therapy?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I want to stop feeling like a terrible parent every time I miss a game. I need to learn how to manage this guilt without it crushing my confidence. Maybe... figure out ways to connect with my son even when I can\u2019t be there in person, and find a better balance between work and family. It\u2019s just so exhausting feeling like I\u2019m failing at both."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I'm wondering if these feelings of guilt and exhaustion have affected other parts of your daily life, like your sleep or appetite?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, it has. I\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping\u2014either lying awake worrying about the next game or waking up in the middle of the night feeling anxious. My appetite\u2019s also been off; some days I forget to eat because I\u2019m so caught up in the guilt, and other days I just don\u2019t feel like cooking for my son and me. It\u2019s like my whole routine is unraveling."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that\u2014I can see how this stress is seeping into many parts of your life. What have you tried so far to manage these feelings of guilt and stress, and how effective have those strategies been?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve tried adjusting my work schedule and asking for time off when possible, but it\u2019s been tough to balance consistently. It helps a little\u2014like when I can attend a game, it eases the guilt temporarily\u2014but most days I still end up criticizing myself. I feel like I\u2019m trying, but it\u2019s never enough."}

{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to check in on your safety. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts of harming myself or ending my life recently. The guilt and stress feel overwhelming at times, but I\u2019m focused on finding ways to manage this situation and be a better parent. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I still hold onto hope that things can get better for my son and me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I'm glad to hear you're holding onto hope for improvement. Let's talk about substances\u2014do you currently use alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances, and have there been any changes in your use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t use alcohol or cannabis, and I haven\u2019t started any new substances recently. I\u2019ve always tried to stay focused on work and family responsibilities without relying on anything like that. My stress has been more about overthinking and sleepless nights than turning to substances."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear you\u2019re deeply committed to your family and work, which is a strength. Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic, irritable, or needed very little sleep\u2014perhaps even taking on more tasks than usual or feeling overly confident in risky decisions?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't experienced those kinds of periods. My energy levels have been low, and I get more irritable when I'm sleep-deprived from stress. The main issue is feeling drained, not overly energetic or confident in risky decisions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s helpful to clarify that your energy patterns don\u2019t include hypomanic symptoms. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don\u2019t, or have thoughts that things are happening to you that others might not believe?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t heard voices or seen things that others don\u2019t. My struggles feel real and overwhelming, but I don\u2019t experience thoughts that things are happening to me in ways others wouldn\u2019t believe. The stress is intense, but it hasn\u2019t led to that kind of symptom."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for your honesty\u2014it shows your commitment to addressing these challenges. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins, and have there been any recent changes to your regimen?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I'm not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins. I haven\u2019t made any recent changes to something that doesn\u2019t exist for me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s reassuring that you\u2019re managing without substances or medications while navigating this stress. What supports or coping strategies have helped you feel more stable or hopeful during this time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Adjusting my work schedule when possible has helped a little, even though it feels like a constant battle. I also try calling my son afterward to check in, but it\u2019s hard to make up for being there. My friends listen, but I avoid bringing up the guilt\u2014it\u2019s easier to keep it bottled than risk sounding like a failure."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing so openly, Cynthia. To recap: Your main concerns are feelings of guilt and inadequacy as a parent for missing your son's games, which has led to sleep disturbances, disrupted routines, and emotional distress. Predisposing factors might include high parental expectations, precipitating factors are work demands conflicting with family time, perpetuating factors are self-criticism and avoidance of social support, and protective factors include your commitment to family and therapy-seeking. Does this align with your experience, or would you add anything to this understanding?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that aligns with how I\u2019ve been feeling. The missed important game was a turning point\u2014it crystallized my fears of failing him. Even after adjusting my schedule, I still can\u2019t stop looping over every missed moment, which exhausts me. My work struggles might be part of the same pressure to \u2018do it all perfectly.\u2019"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much this weighs on you, Cynthia. Let\u2019s build on that\u2014what would you like to focus on next as we work together to address these challenges?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019d like to work on managing the guilt when I can\u2019t be at the games and finding healthier ways to connect with my son remotely. I feel like my self-criticism is ruining everything, so learning to be kinder to myself would help\u2014maybe we could explore why I see \u2018good parent\u2019 as being perfect, not just trying."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like we\u2019ve identified key areas to focus on, including challenging perfectionistic expectations around parenting and developing self-compassion strategies. Before we move forward, is there anything I\u2019ve missed or any other priorities you\u2019d like to add to this plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think those are the main things, but maybe also addressing how to communicate with my son in a way that reassures him I still care, even when I miss games. And figuring out how to stop equating missing a game with being a bad parent\u2014it\u2019s starting to feel like they\u2019re the same thing in my head."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing those important additions, Cynthia. To clarify, we\u2019ve now included strategies for communicating reassurance to your son and untangling the link between missed games and parental worth. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add before we finalize our plan together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think we\u2019ve covered the main areas I wanted to address. I\u2019m hopeful that focusing on self-compassion and finding consistent ways to connect with my son\u2014even remotely\u2014will help ease the guilt. Maybe exploring boundaries at work could also help long-term, but I\u2019m ready to start with what we\u2019ve outlined."}
