{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Sadie, just to make sure I have the correct details\u2014could you confirm your name and let me know if you have any pronoun preferences?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name is Sadie Ellis, and I go by she\/her pronouns."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you, Sadie. This session will focus on understanding your concerns and how we can work together. It will take about 45 minutes. Are you comfortable proceeding with that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I\u2019m a little nervous, but I want to figure out how to feel less... left out. I hope we can work on that together."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You mentioned feeling nervous but committed to working on these feelings of being left out\u2014thank you for sharing that. Is there anything you\u2019d like to ask me before we start?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so\u2026 I guess I just want to know if we can figure out ways to help me feel less left out. I\u2019m not sure where to start, but I want to try."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me more about what's been troubling you lately and how it's been affecting your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Lately, I've been really struggling with feeling like I don't fit in when my friends play video games together. It started a few months ago, and it's gotten worse over time. I try to start game nights or ask them to play with me, but they always end up choosing each other instead. It makes me wonder if they don\u2019t actually want me around, even though I know that\u2019s probably not true. It\u2019s been hard on my confidence, and I\u2019ve been feeling sad a lot, especially when I see them laughing without me. I haven\u2019t talked to them about it directly because I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll just avoid me more."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your courage in sharing this. It sounds like these feelings have been building up and are really affecting your confidence and mood. Can you tell me what prompted you to seek counseling at this time, rather than earlier?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think I tried to ignore it at first, hoping things would get better on their own. But when I realized these feelings weren\u2019t going away and were making me feel sad almost every day, I knew I needed help. My self-esteem started to drop, and I worried it would get worse if I didn\u2019t do something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s commendable that you recognized the need for help and took this step. Can you share more about when these feelings of being left out first began and if there were any specific moments or changes that made them feel worse over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The feelings started a few months ago when I noticed my friends were spending more time playing games with each other instead of including me. It got worse when I tried joining in but they\u2019d act like I wasn\u2019t there, or just say, \u201cWe\u2019re just finishing this match.\u201d Even when I asked to play together, they\u2019d brush me off. It\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible sometimes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Sadie. It\u2019s tough when we feel invisible in groups we care about. How have these feelings been affecting your schoolwork or other daily activities lately? Have you noticed any changes in your energy or focus when this happens?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s made me kinda distracted in class sometimes. I\u2019ll be daydreaming about why my friends don\u2019t want to play with me, and then I miss assignments. Lately, I\u2019ve been dragging my feet on homework because I feel like no one cares if I do well anyway. My head just feels... heavy when I try to focus, like I can\u2019t shake the worry that I\u2019m being left out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how heavy your head feels when you're trying to focus. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or energy levels when you're feeling this way?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping some nights. When I feel left out, my head feels so heavy I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, so I\u2019ll stay up late replaying things in my head. Then the next day I\u2019m just\u2026 really tired, like I can\u2019t catch up. It\u2019s like my energy is drained even if I didn\u2019t do much."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your willingness to share so openly, Sadie. It sounds like these feelings of exclusion have been really heavy to carry. Let\u2019s explore a bit more about your background\u2014have you experienced any challenging or difficult situations in your life (like school stress, family changes, or other tough moments) that might be connected to how you\u2019re feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve faced other major challenges besides this\u2014my life has been pretty stable otherwise. But I guess the stress of school has felt heavier lately, maybe because I\u2019m struggling to focus when I\u2019m already so worried about being left out. It\u2019s like everything piles up when I feel this isolated."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight of school and social worries has been especially heavy lately. Can you tell me a bit about the friends you mentioned you can talk to\u2014how have they supported you during stressful times?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My friends are the kind who listen when I need to vent about, like, school stress or family stuff. They\u2019ll text me to check in or sit with me at lunch. But... I haven\u2019t actually told them how I\u2019ve been feeling about gaming and being excluded. I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll think I\u2019m being dramatic or that it\u2019ll make them avoid me more. When we do talk, I focus on lighter things instead of bringing it up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s understandable to feel hesitant about bringing up such personal concerns, especially when you fear it might change how others see you. Have you experienced similar feelings of being excluded or worried about how others perceive you in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don't think I've experienced anything like this before. I've always been introverted, but this feels... heavier. Like, I used to just keep to myself without it hurting so much. Now it's like a shadow over everything else, which is kinda scary honestly."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense to want to protect your relationships while navigating these feelings. Let\u2019s look at other factors\u2014have you experienced any traumatic events or significant adversities in your life (like bullying, family conflict, or major life changes) that might be influencing how you view social connections now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve experienced anything traumatic like bullying or major family conflicts. My family\u2019s pretty stable, and I\u2019ve never been teased harshly about this. But the isolation feels worse because it started gradually\u2014like when my friends began spending more time together, I noticed myself being excluded more often. It\u2019s hard not to overthink if there\u2019s something *wrong* with me, even if there\u2019s no big event to point to."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness, Sadie. To ensure we address everything important, can you tell me if you've ever had thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had thoughts about harming myself or ending my life. But I do feel overwhelmed sometimes, like the weight of it all might crush me if I don\u2019t find a way to feel included again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing that sense of overwhelm\u2014it sounds really heavy to carry alone. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, my sleep has been really off lately. I\u2019ll lie awake for hours thinking about why my friends don\u2019t include me, and when I finally fall asleep, I wake up exhausted. It\u2019s made me feel sluggish all day, which makes schoolwork harder to focus on\u2014like another thing piling up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sleep disturbances are contributing significantly to your fatigue and academic challenges. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or felt like you don't need as much sleep lately? For example, have you felt unusually restless or had difficulty slowing down your thoughts?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t felt like I need less sleep, but my mind does race sometimes even when I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll lie there replaying moments where I felt excluded or worrying about what friends might be doing without me. It\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t slow down, even when my body is exhausted from carrying that weight all day."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how your mind stays active even when your body is tired\u2014it sounds exhausting. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances in an attempt to cope with these feelings of isolation or anxiety?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used anything like that. I\u2019ve tried starting game nights to feel included, but it still doesn\u2019t work. I just... get stuck in my head more, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much effort you\u2019re putting into finding connection\u2014it\u2019s understandable that starting game nights feels like a step, even if the outcome hasn\u2019t matched your hope. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins, and if so, how are you tolerating them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I\u2019m not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins. My doctor hasn\u2019t prescribed anything for this, and I haven\u2019t really considered it since I\u2019m still focusing on talking things through. I guess I thought maybe working on my confidence or communication would help first."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about not using substances or medications\u2014it shows your commitment to addressing this through thoughtful steps. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or restless, or when you take more risks than usual, even if it\u2019s something small like staying up late or pushing yourself in school?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. Most days I actually feel more drained or sluggish, especially after not sleeping well. When I do push myself in school, it\u2019s more out of trying to stay distracted than taking risks. I guess I sometimes stay up late replaying conversations in my head, but it\u2019s not really a choice\u2014I just can\u2019t stop thinking about feeling left out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about your energy patterns. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or feeling that people are talking about you when they\u2019re not?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t heard voices or seen things others don\u2019t. I sometimes worry my friends are ignoring me, but it\u2019s more about feeling excluded than thinking they\u2019re secretly talking about me. I know they probably don\u2019t mean to leave me out, but it still hurts."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing about the emotional weight of feeling excluded\u2014it\u2019s brave to acknowledge how much this affects your daily life. Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to these symptoms?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t had any medical evaluations for things like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. My main concerns have been about the emotional and social side of feeling left out, not physical health. But I guess it\u2019s possible the tiredness I mentioned could be related to something else? I\u2019ve just assumed it\u2019s stress from school and feeling lonely."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the weight of these feelings\u2014it\u2019s clear how much they\u2019re impacting your life. To wrap up this part of our conversation, can you share what supports or coping strategies have helped you feel more stable or hopeful during difficult moments?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I don\u2019t have many\u2026 I\u2019ve mostly tried playing games alone to feel in control, but it just reminds me of being excluded. Sometimes I\u2019ll listen to music or podcasts to distract myself when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, but the isolation still lingers. I guess I try to tell myself they\u2019re busy, not that I\u2019m unlikable, but it\u2019s hard to believe it."}
