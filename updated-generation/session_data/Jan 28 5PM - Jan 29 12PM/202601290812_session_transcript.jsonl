{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing your background, Rebecca. To clarify, today's session will involve discussing your current concerns and setting a plan for our work together. Would you be comfortable proceeding with that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I\u2019d like to proceed. It\u2019s just\u2026 hard to talk about the rejections without getting overwhelmed, but I\u2019m ready to work on this."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for your courage in sharing that. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about how these sessions will work or what to expect?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I don\u2019t have many questions right now\u2014I just hope these sessions can help me figure out how to stop doubting myself and actually take action without getting paralyzed by rejection. I guess I\u2019m curious how we\u2019ll work on turning my negative thoughts into something productive without making me feel worse about my situation."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 1 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the frustration and self-doubt you're experiencing have been really challenging, especially with the constant rejections. Can you share more about how these feelings typically show up for you\u2014like, are there specific moments or situations where the emotional overwhelm feels most intense?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The worst is when I get a rejection email after waiting weeks for a response. It\u2019s those moments where I start questioning if I\u2019m just not good enough, you know? And then I\u2019ll scroll through LinkedIn or Twitter and see someone I went to class with landing a job or getting a big project\u2014I just\u2026 my chest feels tight, and I get teary-eyed even if I\u2019m trying to convince myself it doesn\u2019t matter. It makes me avoid applying for days, sometimes weeks, because I\u2019m afraid of another letdown. I\u2019ve tried updating my portfolio again and again, but it feels like no one\u2019s even looking at it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these experiences have been building up over time, and I appreciate your courage in sharing them. What led you to decide to seek counseling at this particular time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s because these negative thoughts have started to really drain me. I used to push through the rejections, but now I\u2019m struggling to even work on my portfolio or reach out to clients. My friends have noticed I\u2019ve been withdrawn, and I don\u2019t want to lose my passion entirely. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it feels like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of self-doubt that I can\u2019t break out of on my own."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 2 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your courage in sharing so openly, Rebecca. It sounds like the job market's competitiveness and social media comparisons are significant stressors. Can you tell me about any other challenging experiences or difficult periods in your life that might be connected to these feelings of self-doubt?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, I think part of it goes back to when I was in the web dev course. There was this one time I spent weeks building a project for a class assignment, and my instructor gave pretty harsh feedback. I told myself I just needed to \u2018toughen up,\u2019 but it stayed with me. Now, every rejection feels like that moment all over again\u2014like I\u2019m not as \u2018good\u2019 as others even if I\u2019m doing the work. It\u2019s hard not to compare myself to people who seem to land jobs effortlessly, especially on social media. Those feelings of being \u2018less capable\u2019 have always lurked in the back of my mind, but this past year\u2026 it\u2019s like they\u2019re screaming now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty in unpacking how past experiences shape your current feelings. It takes strength to confront these patterns. Can you share what aspects of your family\u2019s support have been most helpful during challenging times, or any other resources that have helped you cope in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My family listens when I\u2019m upset and reminds me they believe in me, which helps... but they don\u2019t understand the tech industry\u2019s specifics. My cousin once shared a job board link, but that\u2019s about the extent of their practical help. I\u2019ve mostly tried self-improvement\u2014tutorials, portfolio tweaks\u2014but it\u2019s isolating."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you sharing how your family's support helps, even if it's not always practical. It takes strength to keep going despite feeling isolated. Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant challenges in your life that you think might be connected to these feelings of self-doubt?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't experienced any traumatic events specifically. But looking back, I think the pressure I felt to 'make it' right after finishing the course\u2014like it was the only chance to prove myself\u2014might have set me up for this. My parents always emphasized working hard to succeed, so when rejections came, it felt personal, like I\u2019d failed somehow. That probably made the self-doubt worse over time."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 3 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Rebecca, I want to check in about your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself specifically, but there are days when the frustration feels so overwhelming that I wonder if I\u2019ll ever break through this cycle of rejection. It\u2019s more like... a heavy exhaustion than active self-harm thoughts. I\u2019m here because I want to stop letting this drain me emotionally, not because I\u2019ve reached that point yet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your courage in sharing this openly. Let\u2019s explore a bit more about your energy levels\u2014have you noticed any periods where you feel overly energetic or need significantly less sleep, even if it\u2019s just for a few days at a time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced periods of feeling overly energetic or needing less sleep. My sleep issues are more about irregular patterns\u2014sometimes staying up late ruminating about rejections, other times oversleeping to avoid checking emails. It\u2019s not energizing; it\u2019s more like my body\u2019s stuck in a tired, foggy state most days."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about your energy patterns. Let\u2019s move to another important area\u2014have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently? For example, hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or feeling someone is out to harm you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t experienced hallucinations or paranoid thoughts. My main struggles are with self-doubt and feeling overwhelmed by rejections, not with strange perceptions or fears of others harming me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about your experiences so far. Let\u2019s move to another area\u2014could you share whether you currently use alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances, and if so, how often?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t use alcohol or cannabis regularly. Occasionally, I might have a glass of wine to unwind after especially stressful weeks, but it\u2019s not something I rely on. Most nights, I just try to distract myself by working on small coding projects to take my mind off the frustration\u2014though it doesn\u2019t always help."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about your coping strategies. Could you let me know if you\u2019re currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins? If so, how have they been working for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins. I\u2019ve thought about trying something for my sleep sometimes, but I haven\u2019t started anything yet because I didn\u2019t want to add another layer of dependency while I\u2019m already struggling with motivation."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for being so open about your experiences and choices. Let\u2019s briefly cover any medical factors that might be relevant\u2014have you been diagnosed with or treated for any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that could be affecting your energy or mood?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues or sleep apnea. My sleep problems are irregular patterns from stress, not a diagnosed disorder."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your thoroughness in addressing these factors. Could you share whether you currently use or have used stimulants (like Adderall, Ritalin, or energy drinks) or any other substances (e.g., opioids, recreational drugs) for focus, stress relief, or other purposes?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t used stimulants or other substances for focus or stress relief. I\u2019ve tried to cope by working on my portfolio more, even when it feels hopeless, and occasionally my friends suggest taking my mind off it, but I usually say no because I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m avoiding the problem."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your commitment to facing these challenges directly. Could you share what supports or resources have helped you feel more stable or hopeful during particularly difficult times? For example, relationships, activities, or beliefs that ground you when frustration feels overwhelming?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My family has been a consistent support\u2014they listen without judgment, even when they don\u2019t fully grasp the tech industry\u2019s pressures. When I\u2019m really overwhelmed, I sometimes work on small personal projects, like building a website for a hobby or a friend\u2019s business. It helps me reconnect with why I love coding, even if it feels like no one sees my work. But honestly, those moments are rare lately\u2026 most days, the frustration just\u2026 lingers."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness about the rare moments of creative reconnection\u2014it\u2019s a testament to your resilience. --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Thank you for acknowledging those moments\u2014it does help to feel seen. But even when I manage to push through, the fear of rejection still lingers, and I often worry I\u2019m not improving fast enough to catch a real opportunity. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck between wanting to believe in myself and the reality of being ignored."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 4 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"---"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve gathered so far is that over the past year, feelings of frustration and self-doubt have grown as you\u2019ve faced repeated rejections in your job search, which has affected your motivation and sleep. These challenges seem tied to comparisons with others and past feedback that made you question your abilities, though your family\u2019s support and personal coding projects offer some resilience. We\u2019ve explored how fear of rejection leads to avoidance, and we\u2019ve started to identify patterns like self-criticism and social withdrawal. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You didn\u2019t miss much, but maybe the part about how delayed rejection emails\u2014like when a client ghosts or takes weeks to respond\u2014feel worse than immediate no\u2019s. It makes me obsess, like \u2018Did I *almost* get it?\u2019 and then crash harder when they finally say no. Also, my parents mean well, but they keep saying things like \u2018Just work harder!\u2019 which I hear as \u2018You\u2019re not trying enough,\u2019 even though I *am* applying nonstop. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t see the mental toll of constant rejection. Oh, and\u2026 the guilt. Sometimes I feel guilty for being upset, like I \u2018should\u2019 just be grateful for any support instead of needing their understanding. Does that count?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve gathered is that delayed rejections amplify self-doubt by fueling obsessive 'what if' thinking, while well-meaning but misaligned family messages and guilt about needing support deepen your distress. We\u2019ve also noted how isolation and sleep disruptions compound the struggle. What did I miss, and does this align with your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that\u2019s pretty accurate. I think you captured the main points, but one detail you might\u2019ve missed is how the delayed rejections\u2014especially the ones that take weeks to process\u2014make me spiral into thinking I\u2019m not just \u2018unlucky,\u2019 but fundamentally unskilled. It\u2019s not just the rejections themselves, but the silence that feels like a personal erasure. Also, my parents\u2019 focus on \u2018success\u2019 adds pressure; they mean well, but their lack of tech understanding makes me feel like I have to prove myself all alone. And yeah, those small personal projects *do* reignite passion briefly, but they also highlight the gap between passion and actual career progress. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in a loop of trying harder but feeling like it\u2019s never enough."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve gathered is that delayed rejections amplify self-doubt by fueling obsessive 'what if' thinking, while well-meaning but misaligned family messages and guilt about needing support deepen your distress. We\u2019ve also noted how isolation and sleep disruptions compound the struggle. What did I miss, and does this align with your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that\u2019s pretty much it, but maybe add how seeing peers\u2019 successes triggers physical reactions\u2014like chest tightness and sudden tears\u2014that make me avoid applying for weeks. Also, the guilt about \u2018burdening\u2019 my family with my struggles, even though they\u2019re supportive, adds to the pressure. And the tech industry\u2019s \u2018hustle culture\u2019 messages make me feel like my slow progress is a personal failure, not just a common challenge. Those pieces matter too."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve gathered is that physical reactions to rejection (like chest tightness and sudden tears) and guilt about needing support\u2014despite family\u2019s good intentions\u2014create a cycle of avoidance and self-criticism, worsened by industry pressures framing slow progress as failure. We\u2019ve also clarified how your personal projects offer brief respite but highlight career stagnation. What did I miss, and does this align with how you see it? If so, what might be one small step we could explore together to address this cycle?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that aligns with how I see it. What might be missing is how the lack of understanding from my family\u2014while they mean well\u2014makes me feel like I have to hide my struggles, which adds to the guilt when I do reach out. A small step could be setting a 15-minute daily 'application block' where I focus only on submitting one job or project, no matter how small, to rebuild confidence without overloading myself. If I fail to do it, I\u2019d write down *one* thing I learned about myself that day instead of spiraling into self-criticism."}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Phase 5 End ---"}
{"role":"system","content":"--- Session Summary ---\n\nSubjective: Reports persistent self-doubt and emotional overwhelm linked to job rejections, with symptoms including chest tightness, teary-eyed reactions, and sleep disturbances (irregular patterns, rumination). Avoidance of applications for days\/weeks post-rejection. Guilt about needing support despite family\u2019s good intentions. Delayed rejections amplify 'what if' spirals and feelings of personal erasure. Family messages (e.g., 'work harder') perceived as invalidating. Tech industry 'hustle culture' exacerbates self-criticism.\n\nObjective: No acute safety concerns; denies suicidal ideation or hallucinations. Occasional wine use for stress relief; no substances for focus. Sleep irregularities tied to stress, not diagnosed disorder. Avoidance behaviors (e.g., skipping applications) and isolation noted. Small personal coding projects provide brief respite but highlight career stagnation.\n\nAssessment: Chronic self-doubt and rejection sensitivity likely rooted in past instructor feedback and imposter syndrome. Family dynamics and social media comparisons compound distress. Avoidance and rumination perpetuate emotional exhaustion. No medical\/psychotic contributors identified.\n\nPlan: Implement 15-minute daily 'application block' with nonjudgmental reflection if missed. Explore cognitive reframing for rejection narratives. Address family communication patterns. Monitor sleep hygiene. Consider gradual exposure to application processes paired with self-compassion exercises.\n\n--- End Summary ---"}
